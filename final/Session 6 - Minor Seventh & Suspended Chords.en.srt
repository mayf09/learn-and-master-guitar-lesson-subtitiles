00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,130
Hi, welcome to session six,

2
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,470
in this session, we're going to talk about minor seventh chords and suspended chords,

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,210
if we have a little bit more color in them

4
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,490
than the basic chords that we've been talking about so far,

5
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,550
but they still are open chords, that involve open strings.

6
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,740
We're also going to talk about strumming

7
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,370
and strumming with ties which gets a little bit more complicated,

8
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,040
but sure makes it sound a little bit more musically interesting,

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,580
when we do it,

10
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,350
in the guitar tips section,

11
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,800
we're going to talk about practicing strumming patterns without music,

12
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,570
we'll work with music here,

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,580
but I also want to talk about doing it without music,

14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,680
because that's the kind of situations, that you're going to be in,

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,160
when you're trying to play with friends or in a group situation like that.

16
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,640
So let's go ahead and get started.

17
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,270
Okay, now let's talk about the minor seventh chords,

18
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,240
three minor seventh chords, we're gonna cover in this, this section,

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,650
Am7, Dm7 and Em7,

20
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,650
abbreviated A little m 7,

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,190
the little m and the 7 is telling you it's a minor seventh chord,

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,470
so let's look at that Am7 chord first,

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,150
okay five string chord,

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,900
everything in the family is going to be a five string chord,

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,700
so there's nothing happening on that six string.

26
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,480
We have open A,

27
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,250
second finger on E,

28
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,710
open G,

29
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,090
first fingers C

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,070
and open E,

31
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,160
just play it altogether.

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,890
It's kind of like a C chord,

33
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,210
if you take your third finger off,

34
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,320
pretty much the same thing.

35
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,020
Now let's talk about Dm7,

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,120
this one is a little bit different from the others,

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,500
it's a four string chord,

38
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,240
all the D's are four string chord,

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,010
so let's look what's happening here,

40
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,960
we've got open D,

41
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,850
I've got my second finger on this A

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,610
and here's the problem right here,

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,710
I need to put my first finger,

44
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,140
he needs to cover two strings at once,

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,490
needs to pull double duty,

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,180
I've got an F and I've also got a C,

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,830
that I need to cover,

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,140
now I guess I could really do that,

49
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,630
that's not the right way to do it,

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,700
put your second finger on that A

51
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,510
and then I want you to put your first finger down over both of those strings,

52
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:57,910
now, this that's the we're in the baby pool of barre chords,

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,950
this is the introduction to barre chords,

54
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,940
let me show you,

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,150
so let me talk about this for saying,

56
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,260
it's a pretty big concept.

57
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,230
What you don't want to do is raise this wrist up,

58
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,000
because it's hard to push down those two strings,

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,170
you raise that wrist up,

60
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,610
you crank this up here

61
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,590
and you end up doing something like this,

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,330
now it may work a little bit,

63
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,340
but when we get to more complex barre chords,

64
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,620
you'll see that that is not going to work very very well at all,

65
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,450
so here's what you need to do,

66
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,890
lower that wrist,

67
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,490
put your finger out,

68
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,490
your joint will go in,

69
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,880
but it will also go a little bit inverted, not very much,

70
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,260
but I'll go a little bit inverted,

71
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,820
it's the inverted,

72
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,400
how the muscles are there is,

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,140
how you do these barre chords,

74
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,550
especially these little ones like that,

75
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,560
get your two, get your finger over those two strings, kind of invert that,

76
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,710
that's a good way to get a lot of pressure focused into one spot,

77
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,820
if you try and do it

78
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,880
by just putting your, raising your wrist and pulling your finger back

79
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,250
is not a very efficient way to do it,

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,150
put that wrist down, put that finger in front, pressing down,

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,290
inverting that first finger, catching that,

82
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,060
now trying to add that A to it,

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,070
so now look what I've got going,

84
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,580
I've got one joint that's going normal,

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,080
one that's going inverted,

86
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,290
I'm doing two different things with two different joint, joints,

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,180
it's a little bit tricky to do it first,

88
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,260
but that's the Dm7,

89
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,160
once you do it a couple times,

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
you'll get, you'll get the hang of.

91
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,080
Okay, the last one is an Em7,

92
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,370
we're going to talk about E's family chords six strings,

93
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,920
okay, it's two different fingerings we can use,

94
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,450
two different alternate fingerings on this,

95
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,740
let me teach you the first one,

96
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,610
this one I like,

97
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
don't necessarily have to do it like I do,

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
there's different guys do it different ways.

99
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,390
Open E,

100
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,760
now I put my first finger on this B,

101
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,480
then I have two open strings and D and G,

102
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,990
then I have my third finger on this high D,

103
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,480
my pinky on this high G,

104
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,450
Em7.

105
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,190
Now another way to do that,

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,270
which I think is a little bit more awkward,

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,620
so it's been a bit more awkward to me,

108
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,700
but a lot of guys use it,

109
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,260
is an open E,

110
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,090
second finger up here on this B,

111
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,170
third finger on this E,

112
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,970
G,

113
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,940
pinky covering D,

114
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,230
the last string open,

115
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,300
now you'll notice the finger is completely different for this one,

116
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,470
how can it be the same chord,

117
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,020
well chord is just a combination of tones,

118
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,510
no matter how many ways I slice them,

119
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,800
there's still chords,

120
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,020
there's still the same chord,

121
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,540
so it doesn't matter really what order I have the notes in,

122
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,870
so here's version one,

123
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,320
here's version two,

124
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,940
either way you can use fun

125
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,270
and whatever lanes better with your hand,

126
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,030
let's do some of the minor chord exercises.

127
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,740
Okay, basic open chord exercises using minor sevenths,

128
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,050
look at number one there, we have Am,

129
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,050
and then we're gonna go to Am7,

130
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,080
the rhythms you'll notice you're getting a little more complex as well,

131
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,790
let's do it real slowly.

132
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,120
Ready, go,

133
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,450
Am7, now take that third finger off,

134
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,880
D7, now,

135
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,280
three Gs in a row,

136
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,100
How did you do, let's try one more time.

137
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,190
Ready, play,

138
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,350
third finger off,

139
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,480
D7

140
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,260
three G in a row.

141
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,190
Okay, now let's do exercise number two,

142
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,880
this one starts on a D

143
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,550
and this gives us a good workout on that Em7 chord.

144
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,540
Okay, starts on a D, nice and slow,

145
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:19,550
ready, play,

146
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,940
Em7, take a second to get to it,

147
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,440
either form you want to use is fine,

148
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,840
Am7, D,

149
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,480
G.

150
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,760
Very good, let's try one more time,

151
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:58,700
D, Em7, D 1 2, G.

152
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:11,120
Great okay, now let's scoot down the page a little bit to number three,

153
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,140
I was going to go down farther,

154
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,010
but let's do number three,

155
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,080
that gives us a good workout on the Dm7,

156
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
okay, pretty simple rhythm,

157
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,040
it's the same rhythm for all the four measures,

158
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,420
let's start on that C,

159
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,190
ready, go,

160
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,520
one two, same thing,

161
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,750
now here's that Dm7,

162
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,370
make sure you form it correctly,

163
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,920
inverting that first finger,

164
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,360
here we go,

165
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,930
four string chord,

166
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:51,080
back to C repeat,

167
00:08:51,780 --> 00:09:00,030
Dm7, go,

168
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,970
very good.

169
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,930
Okay before we talk about suspended chords,

170
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,700
when you talk about strumming for a second,

171
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,820
because we're getting more complex with our rhythms,

172
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,640
there strumming is going to have to change a little bit as well,

173
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,220
let's talk about good technique for strumming,

174
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,590
now at this point, we've pretty much just been going down down down down,

175
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,610
we need to do an up,

176
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,870
there'll be a bunch of [] row

177
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,340
and we'll go down up, down up, down up, down up,

178
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,470
even when you are doing just downs,

179
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,250
your hand is still doing a silent up,

180
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,510
if you think about it,

181
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,120
okay, so your hand is always doing this cycle,

182
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,830
down up, down up, down up, down,

183
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,360
it's kind of a piston in a car,

184
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,690
it's always going down up, down up, down up, down up,

185
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,680
okay, so when I'm practicing this strumming,

186
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,450
now we're going to get a little more complex,

187
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,170
be thinking of that,

188
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,100
so you don't want to go down down down down down,

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,240
that would be wrong,

190
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
down, down up, down, down,

191
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,940
if you want good smooth strumming,

192
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,160
see how if I do all downs, it sounds a little bit different

193
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,690
and as we get more complex,

194
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,130
it's going to really start throwing you off,

195
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,930
it's going to make sure you understand what we're doing,

196
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,090
I'm never going to tell you to be up,

197
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,790
when you're in the cycle to be down or the opposite,

198
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,640
it may be a little confusing at first,

199
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,750
but pretty soon you'll realize that,

200
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,980
that's really the only way you could do it,

201
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,750
if you keep that cycle consistent,

202
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,880
okay, that's about strumming.

203
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,700
Now, let's talk about adding ties into the, inside of our strumming chords,

204
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,770
okay, so just on a G chord,

205
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,350
let's do exercise number one.

206
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,490
Okay, the first part of exercise number one is without the tie

207
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,830
and the second part I through in the tie,

208
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,610
your strumming pattern is going to change just slightly,

209
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,730
but the up and down cycle of your hand is the same,

210
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,860
whether I'm hitting the strings or not hitting the strings.

211
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,970
Number one, A, on a G chord,

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,600
down, down up, down,

213
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,610
okay, one more time, down up, down,

214
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,530
now even though it's just a half note,

215
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,180
I want you to keep your hand going,

216
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,740
very important concept,

217
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,420
keep your hand going

218
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,290
or you're going to forever get turned around on where you need to be playing,

219
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,460
the secret is,

220
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,300
let me tell you the secret,

221
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,590
for somebody's done it for years,

222
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:39,700
keep your hand going, okay, down, down up, down,

223
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,510
now I know you're saying yourself,

224
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,850
why should I keep my hand going on just a half note,

225
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,750
I'm going to get worn out,

226
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,360
I'm going to die early, die young in my life,

227
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,280
because I'm wasting all my energy doing this,

228
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,550
no, you need to keep that,

229
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,770
because as we get more and more complex with our rhythms,

230
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,420
if you don't keep that hand going,

231
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,070
to sound [], you're going to be able to keep up.

232
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,940
Okay, now, 1b, I'm going to throw that tie in,

233
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,420
we had been going down, down up, down,

234
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,280
now, I'm just going to take away one of those downs,

235
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,280
and see what happens,

236
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,040
down, down up,

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,410
down, down up, down up, down up,

238
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,090
down, down up, down up, down up,

239
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,730
you're ending your strum on up beat,

240
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,020
feels kind of funny.

241
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,920
Okay, let's try one more time,

242
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,380
down, down up,

243
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,210
a little bit faster,

244
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,240
there you go,

245
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,370
take a while for you to kind of get the concept of this,

246
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
down up, down up.

247
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,970
Let's do number two,

248
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,080
the first part is a, without the tie,

249
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,530
down, down up, down up, down,

250
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,220
again,

251
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,100
when I have the tie in,

252
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,160
it then becomes down, down up, up, down,

253
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,100
down, down up, up, down,

254
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,770
okay, again, don't get confused,

255
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,680
what's the rule, keep your hand going,

256
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,090
if your hand is always going,

257
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,600
you'll end up being in the right part of the cycle to land on it,

258
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,340
one more time, 2b,

259
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,240
down, down up, up, down,

260
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,620
I'll slow it down even a little more,

261
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,800
down, down up,

262
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,450
there's a silent down there,

263
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,910
then we come back into it.

264
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,210
Great, let's do number three, without the tie first,

265
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,700
ready, go,

266
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,430
keep your hand going,

267
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,180
again.

268
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,610
Okay, now the b section,

269
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,990
I'm gonna throw that tie in,

270
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,240
down up, keep your hand going,

271
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,590
down up, down up, keep your hands going,

272
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,340
a little bit faster,

273
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,540
a little bit faster, go,

274
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,270
one more go,

275
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:24,560
very good, here you go, great, okay.

276
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,960
Now, I think we're ready for suspended chords,

277
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,940
okay, we're just going to cover three of them,

278
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,520
this will be the last of our basic chords,

279
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,810
you have covered probably close to twenty chords in the last,

280
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,990
this session and past sessions,

281
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,740
so we have crammed a lot of chords into you, in a very short amount of time,

282
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,590
may take a while to process all of those,

283
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,440
the last three we're going to cover are suspended chords,

284
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,280
suspended chords is just a way of referring to,

285
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,570
they're going to take the third note of the scale and suspend it up to the fourth.

286
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,810
We'll learn a little bit more about the mechanics of that a little bit,

287
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,320
but just realize it's related to the major chord.

288
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,980
A, our major chord is like this,

289
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,250
now for suspended chords,

290
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,860
suspended chords almost always involve your pinky,

291
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,860
slide that pinky out just one fret,

292
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,920
that's an Asus.

293
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,420
Now, you may be saying yourself,

294
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,770
well why don't I just play it like this,

295
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,630
well, that's a possibility,

296
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,110
but let's talk about why that's not a good idea,

297
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,790
suspended chords almost always come right next to a major chord,

298
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,440
it's kind of like a [] and a you,

299
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,580
you always seen together,

300
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,070
like if I'm playing A,

301
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,520
see I'm just putting my pinky out,

302
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,770
if I did it the other way, it wouldn't work,

303
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,380
I have to really whack out my hand in order to get to work,

304
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,300
so it's much easier to do with your pinky,

305
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,890
that's why I encourage you to learn that way.

306
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,570
Okay, Dsus as the next one,

307
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,750
okay, now look carefully at the numbers on that chord block,

308
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,140
tells you where those where to put your fingers,

309
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,700
it may seem odd at first,

310
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,280
but remember we're relating it to the major chord,

311
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,630
here's a D,

312
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,460
I just put my pinky down,

313
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,650
that's a Dsus,

314
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,980
don't play like that, that's not a good way to play it,

315
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,040
play it with a D, Dsus,

316
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,130
D, Dsus,

317
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,420
on all the suspended chords,

318
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,890
I'm just moving my pinky,

319
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,020
see how that works.

320
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,860
Now, the next one, the last one is an E, and Esus,

321
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,570
we start with the E,

322
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,730
Esus, sneak that pinky right underneath there,

323
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,930
it's kind of like an A chord,

324
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,580
just you moved everything up the string set,

325
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,580
okay back to E.

326
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,570
Now, if you want to take your first finger off,

327
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,950
it really doesn't matter,

328
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,170
because it's being covered by the pinky anyway,

329
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,070
I don't know, I might just go and leave it on.

330
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,530
Okay, alright now move on to your suspended chord exercises,

331
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,790
let's go through a couple of those,

332
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,370
starting with number one, starts on an A,

333
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,850
look at the rhythm,

334
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,470
ready, go,

335
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,660
Asus, slide pinky out,

336
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,230
keep that hand going,

337
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,400
Asus go,

338
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,510
that's a little quick,

339
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,760
let's try, that let's slow that down just a little bit,

340
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,900
same thing,

341
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,590
play,

342
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,510
keep your hand going

343
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,350
Asus,

344
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,330
D go,

345
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,580
Asus,

346
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,350
there you go, much better.

347
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,010
Okay, now, number two we're going to start throwing those ties in,

348
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,720
okay, look at that rhythm,

349
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,160
starts on a D,

350
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,060
quarter to eight going into that half note with a tie,

351
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,980
keep your hand going, that's the rule,

352
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,610
ready, go,

353
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,830
listen to it first,

354
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,680
down up, keep your hand going,

355
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:33,920
Dsus,

356
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,720
now to a G,

357
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,410
Dsus.

358
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,050
Good, it all works out,

359
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,670
if you remember to keep that hand going,

360
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,840
try it one more time,

361
00:18:52,460 --> 00:19:07,340
now a G go, Dsus,

362
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,910
here you go.

363
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,390
Very good, let's do, let's see number three,

364
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,580
give us a little workout on that Esus.

365
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,720
Okay, look at this rhythm,

366
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:23,210
down, down up, down, down, down up, down,

367
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,890
here we go, number three,

368
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,530
we will start slow,

369
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,610
ready, go,

370
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:36,750
down, down up, down, Esus,

371
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,080
a little bit faster,

372
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:05,940
my hand always going down up, down up, down up, down up, down up, down,

373
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,950
my hand is always going in that cycle,

374
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,320
as soon as you start getting a tempo

375
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,760
and even when we're just counting things off,

376
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,610
get that hand started down up, down up,

377
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,230
and things will work out better.

378
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,280
Okay, welcome to the guitar tips section,

379
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,570
in this section, we're going to give you three main strumming patterns,

380
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,580
now I don't want to get so lost in the downs and downs up,

381
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,840
am I am down on my up,

382
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,750
don't get too worried about that,

383
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,920
let me play the rhythm,

384
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,300
you play it back,

385
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,680
and then we'll kind of do it together

386
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,540
and I want you want you kind of got the flow of it,

387
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,130
not to look at the page anymore

388
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,620
and just to listen and see if you can get the flow of it,

389
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,510
once you kind of get the flow of it,

390
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,190
it starts working a whole lot better.

391
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,990
We're just gonna go on a G chord,

392
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,780
example number one, look at that,

393
00:20:52,780 --> 00:21:01,230
it would be down, down up, up, down, down, down up, up, down,

394
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:08,130
on a G, one two, ready go,

395
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:20,040
just keep doing that for a while,

396
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,220
let's switch to a C chord,

397
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:38,280
down, down up, up, down, down, down up, up, down, down, down up,

398
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,350
let's go back to G chord,

399
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,260
try not to look at the music,

400
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,940
try just play it and feel the flow of it,

401
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,280
down, down up, up, down,

402
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,150
C chord,

403
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,760
let's speed it up a little bit,

404
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,650
down up, up, down, down, down up,

405
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,360
G chord,

406
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:22,140
we go a little faster,

407
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,320
C chord,

408
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,400
G chord,

409
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:47,070
there you go, very good, start like music,

410
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,940
when we speed it up,

411
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,650
if you break it down,

412
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,060
it's just that one pattern,

413
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,070
down, down up, up, down.

414
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,710
Second one I wanted to cover is a little bit different,

415
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,000
we just add a little more things to it,

416
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,750
down up, down up, up, down.

417
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,070
Okay, let's try that,

418
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,300
same thing on a G chord,

419
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,610
we'll start it slow and then we'll speed up,

420
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,050
ready play,

421
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,230
down up, down up, up, down,

422
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,330
down up, down up, up, down,

423
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,710
down up, down up, up, down,

424
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,610
one more time,

425
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,670
let's go to an Em chord, Em,

426
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,570
down up, up, down,

427
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,510
think about making it smooth,

428
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,400
there you go, back to G,

429
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,920
a little bit faster now,

430
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,600
loosen up that wrist,

431
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:06,880
a little bit faster, Em.

432
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,570
Very good, now, the third and last one I want to cover is a little bit different from that,

433
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,910
look at this one,

434
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,420
down up, up, up, down,

435
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,800
you got three ups in a row,

436
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,220
down up, up, up, down,

437
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,760
down up, up, up, down,

438
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,160
let's do, let's do it on a C chord,

439
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,650
little slow,

440
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,600
ready, play,

441
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,700
down up, up, up, down,

442
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:59,620
down up, up, up, down,

443
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,710
see when I want to put my fingers on the strings,

444
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,180
I just bring that wrist closer,

445
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,280
when I want to take them away, I bring that wrist out,

446
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,730
but that cycle is always going down up, down up, down up,

447
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,500
so I can go through all kinds of rhythms,

448
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:28,170
as long as my hands going keeps in that cycle,

449
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,190
it all works out.

450
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,600
Here's your assignment for this session,

451
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,500
I want you to do the minor seventh and the suspended chord exercises in your book,

452
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,900
play through the basic chord songs,

453
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,870
that we have a schedule for this session as well,

454
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,630
play through them with the notes,

455
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,010
so we don't forget our single notes,

456
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,770
since we've been in chord land here for a while

457
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,350
and I want to also go back and play through with the chords,

458
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,750
now we've got some strumming patterns to put with these as well,

459
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,940
so it's going to start sounding a whole lot more like music.

460
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,990
So we'll see at the workshop time.

461
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,250
Okay, welcome to the workshop section,

462
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,460
let's review our minor seventh chords that we learned earlier,

463
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,170
Am7,

464
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,150
altogether,

465
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,760
Dm7,

466
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,430
remember our little barre here,

467
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,900
invert that knuckle there,

468
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,560
get that sound nice and strong,

469
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,560
Em7, again there's two ways to do this,

470
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:40,910
or the other way.

471
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,610
Alright, suspended chords, we learned three different types of those,

472
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,110
we have Asus,

473
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,950
remember these use our pinky,

474
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,850
Dsus,

475
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,200
Esus.

476
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,360
Now, we're gonna look at some different chord exercises,

477
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,790
look at the sheet chords in the key of C,

478
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,140
let's do number one,

479
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,720
remember how we talked about ties with strumming,

480
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,350
this one involves that,

481
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,000
one of our main strumming patterns,

482
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,410
in fact our first strumming pattern,

483
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,570
down, down up, up, down,

484
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,290
here we go,

485
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,520
chords in the key of C,

486
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,350
number one, ready, go,

487
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:09,630
do it again.

488
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,710
Good, number two, ready go,

489
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:30,110
there, works the same way,

490
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,060
do it again,

491
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,550
down up, down up, up,

492
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:48,330
G, Em.

493
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,440
Number three,

494
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,160
one two, number three, go,

495
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:09,590
Dm7, watch that barre.

496
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,210
Let's get down to number five,

497
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,420
two, ready, number five go,

498
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,800
down, down up, up, down up,

499
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,090
down, down up, up, down up,

500
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,560
down down up,

501
00:29:48,590 --> 00:30:07,690
good, do it again, two ready, go.

502
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,980
Six, two three, go,

503
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,650
down up,

504
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,370
Am7, down, keep that hand going,

505
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,990
G here,

506
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,190
another one, G7,

507
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,670
a little bit faster, go,

508
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,070
Am7, go,

509
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,380
G, go,

510
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,590
G7.

511
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,360
Okay, now let's look at chords in the key of G,

512
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,250
okay, look at number one there,

513
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,350
ready go,

514
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:02,490
Am.

515
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:09,120
Number two, two, ready, go,

516
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,960
Em,

517
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,100
Am7,

518
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,610
here comes Dsus,

519
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,570
we do that one again,

520
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,650
one two, number two again, go,

521
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,550
Em,

522
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,180
Am7,

523
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,900
Dsus.

524
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,570
Good, let's skip down way down number five,

525
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,800
check that one out,

526
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,030
starts on a G,

527
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,100
ready play,

528
00:31:51,720 --> 00:32:03,780
up, down up, down, down up, up, down up.

529
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,980
Let's do number six,

530
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,390
one two, keep that hand going,

531
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,680
ready go,

532
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,360
down up,

533
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:19,750
Em7, Am7, D7, G,

534
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,290
one more time, go,

535
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:35,870
Em7, Am7, D7, G.

536
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,620
Okay, let's look at chord exercises in D, chords in the key of D,

537
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,540
okay, let's start off this one,

538
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,100
let's do number two first,

539
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,740
now I'm kind of skipping around on some of these exercises,

540
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,870
the rest you can kind of do on your own,

541
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,190
but let's look at number two.

542
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,580
Okay, starts on that D7,

543
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,180
one, two and and go,

544
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:09,460
Em7, A7 go, G7 here,

545
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,070
I'm going to repeat, do it again,

546
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,690
Great, let's do number three,

547
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,400
ready play,

548
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,500
down up, up, down,

549
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,290
here comes this Asus,

550
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,060
back to A,

551
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,750
a little bit faster, do it again,

552
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,600
if you find it a bit too fast,

553
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,670
just stop it practice a little bit

554
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,560
and see if you can catch up to it when we do it again.

555
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,600
Let's skip down to,

556
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,860
all of us do number five,

557
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,430
ready go,

558
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,290
down up, down up, up, down,

559
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,810
down up, do it again.

560
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:38,100
Now, I want you to look at number six,

561
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,870
number six is kind of where it gets fun,

562
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,160
it's a little bit more complicated,

563
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,990
so it starts sounding like some real music,

564
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,690
let's take a look at this real slowly.

565
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,400
Okay, I have you coming in after that D and G, that up,

566
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,780
that's first time we've done this,

567
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,730
so it may take a little practice,

568
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,590
let's do that first measure only,

569
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,700
nice and slow,

570
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,180
ready go,,

571
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,320
up down,

572
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,290
here's that G, up down,

573
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,810
try it again, just that first measure, go,

574
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,950
down up, down, up, down,

575
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:19,920
again, down up, down, up, down,

576
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,360
what's the secret, keep that hand going,

577
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,060
down up, down up, down up, down, there you go.

578
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:32,230
Okay, let's play all, going to play all four measures for you,

579
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:50,030
ready go,

580
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,550
do do it again,

581
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,170
two, ready, play,

582
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:11,670
as speed up,

583
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:32,640
it starts sounding a bit more like a song,

584
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,060
very good, a lot of songs have that same little chord progression.

585
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,420
Okay, now we're going to talk about,

586
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,740
I gave you one song,

587
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,330
actually there's a couple of songs in there

588
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,280
and remember with all these exercises

589
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,310
go through every exercise that you can in these books,

590
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,280
as well, the Jam Along CDs have extra songs on them,

591
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,660
that you can refer to as well,

592
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,870
so you can always have a chance to get as much practice as you need to.

593
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,470
Okay, we're gonna go over one song called greensleeves,

594
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,060
okay, it's kind of a Christmas song,

595
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,980
but a very familiar melody.

596
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,750
Okay, let's take a look at it,

597
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,640
go into the single notes first,

598
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,170
nice and slow,

599
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,580
it starts on A,

600
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,160
ready, go,

601
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,280
one two,

602
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,830
#F,

603
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,830
dotted quarter,

604
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,410
#G, #F, #G,

605
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,050
a bit of tricky, finger twister there,

606
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,280
#G, #F, #G,

607
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,860
A, two three,

608
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,120
another A,

609
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,950
next part go,

610
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,110
two three,

611
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,700
here comes an #F,

612
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,150
two three,

613
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:32,030
G, two three,

614
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,110
here it comes again,

615
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,440
yeah, really stretch that pinky out to catch that #F.

616
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Okay, now I'm gonna play it one more time at tempo,

617
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,410
okay, so it'll be a little bit faster this time,

618
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,980
ready, go

619
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:32,080
two three.

620
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,750
Great, okay, now we're gonna play the chords with it,

621
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,750
I'm going to give you a simple strumming pattern I want you to do,

622
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,840
just kind of down, down up, down.

623
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,790
Okay, three four times,

624
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,410
only three beats are in there,

625
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,690
down, down up, down.

626
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,320
Okay, starts on that Am7,

627
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:21,630
ready go,,

628
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:49,040
E7,

629
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,370
try make your strums nice and steady.

630
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,940
Very good, and that Greensleeves,

631
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,470
now leave you to practice on your own

632
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,820
to speed it up a little bit

633
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,990
and make a little more to it,

634
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,160
now there's also some other songs in your in your resources that you have available,

635
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,380
go ahead and go through as many as you can.

636
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,530
Now, before we go in our last minute,

637
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,210
I want to explain to you,

638
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,620
you've probably realized by now,

639
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,690
that guitar playing takes a little bit of effort,

640
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,160
I'm sure you thought that you could just watch a little something and you'd be able to play guitar,

641
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,990
but it does take an awful lot of effort,

642
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,860
but it's well worth,

643
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,940
the time and effort that you're putting in into your musicianship, into your,

644
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,580
making yourself a better person

645
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,230
by learning how to play guitar,

646
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,450
yes it's tough and a lot of people quit,

647
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,430
but you've stuck around and you're continuing to do it

648
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,670
and I think you're going to be the one that reaches the rewards out of this,

649
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,520
if guitar playing was easy, then everybody would do it,

650
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,000
usually everybody can kind of thumb around a few chords,

651
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,950
but for folks to actually know what they're doing

652
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,320
and get a few more chords and go just beyond average,

653
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,460
it takes some effort

654
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,020
and that's what this is about,

655
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,460
in life, there are three kinds of people,

656
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,430
there's quitters, campers and climbers,

657
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,560
quitters, look at the task ahead of them,

658
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,450
they say nah there's no way I could ever do that,

659
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,850
and campers get halfway up

660
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,190
and they think man, this is as far as I care to go,

661
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,490
it's just the cost is too much, it takes too much effort,

662
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,410
but there are those of you that climb

663
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,600
and I want to keep going to try and climb

664
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,960
and to get to the musical levels that they want to get to.
