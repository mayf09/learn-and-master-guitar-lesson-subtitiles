00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,280
Hi, welcome to learn and master guitar session seven,

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,430
in this session, we're going to cover lots of great important things,

3
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,350
are going to start talking about barre chords,

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,530
and until this point we've talked about open chords,

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,940
some of your basic chords,

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,430
in the keys that guitar players personally,

7
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,250
like, C G D A and E,

8
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,220
now we're going to start talking about getting into other keys

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,220
and I'm going to teach you the secret to playing in any key,

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,460
that you ever ask to be playing is barre chords,

11
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,740
we're talking about ways to strengthen our fingers,

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,060
so that our fingers are able to to play the barre chords, like we need to,

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,000
a lot of folks complain about they can't get their fingers strong enough,

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,320
so we're going to talk about that a little bit,

15
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,420
we're also going to learn all of the notes,

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,990
on the entire neck of the guitar on the sixth string,

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,460
okay, which is the string that we used to pivot off, pivot these barre chords off of.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,770
We're also going to start a new section,

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,340
this [DVD] called how music works,

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,900
a little bit about music theory,

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,680
a little bit about some of the understanding of why music works the way,

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,610
it does first thing we're going to talk about is half steps and whole steps in music,

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,400
going about building a major scale,

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,110
so we've got an awful lot to cover,

25
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,160
I hope you're ready to go,

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,940
let's get started.

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,880
Okay, let's talk about barre chords,

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,210
barre chords opens up a whole new world for us,

29
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,620
as we play guitar,

30
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,290
it shifts us from just playing in a couple of keys,

31
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,270
so now we can play in any key,

32
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,440
and that's what barre chords allow us to do,

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,470
barre chords, let me explain that first of all,

34
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,030
it's not b a r, it's b a r r e,

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,540
sometimes the spelling you might think we've misspelled things throughout the whole book,

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,800
no, not at all,

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,480
the barre is b a r r e,

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,130
when we get into barre chords,

39
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,870
there's a couple things before we have to get there,

40
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,250
I've got to show you a couple of skills,

41
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,640
that you can get your hands strengthened on,

42
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,310
its where you're able to do the barres, when we get to them,

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,910
here in a minute.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,670
First thing we need to talk about is our hand position,

45
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,290
let's review some of the good things,

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,790
that we need to do with our hand position,

47
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,480
and this is going to become real critical here,

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,100
as we get into these bigger chords,

49
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,590
now before when we're doing our Cs and our Gs and Ams,

50
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,030
remember I told you,

51
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,890
we need to have our wrist down,

52
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,780
there needs to be air space between our bottom of our wrist or palm,

53
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,390
the face of our palm and the bottom of the guitar,

54
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,240
you don't want your thumb hanging over the top,

55
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,040
especially when we get to barre chords,

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,810
it just doesn't work, when they have it like that,

57
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,860
we're going to lower that wrist, bring that first finger out

58
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,420
and he's going to be straight,

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,630
this is one of the keys to playing barre chords well,

60
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,750
is getting that first finger straight, okay.

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,310
Now, bar chords,

62
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,240
let's talk about the difference between barre chords and movable chords,

63
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,000
they're they're really the same thing,

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,310
but barre chords tells you a little bit more about,

65
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,530
barre chords mean that, when you barre,

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,170
that's telling you that,

67
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,560
you're using one finger to cover more than one string,

68
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,520
okay, not all movable chords use barres,

69
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,500
but for our purposes right now, they will,

70
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,930
so you're covering one,

71
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,090
you're using one finger to cover more than one string,

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,030
now, this requires a lot of work for our first finger,

73
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,220
so we're going to have to strengthen him up

74
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,720
and we're going to cover that in just a second,

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,910
but before that, I need to show you a little bit about,

76
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,300
how we move these chords along the neck,

77
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,360
we need to learn all the notes on this six string first,

78
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,250
so that when it's time to move those chords,

79
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,540
we know where we're moving them to.

80
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,310
Okay, so let's talk about the six string here for a second.

81
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,030
Need to teach you musical concept called half steps and whole steps,

82
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,860
half steps and whole steps,

83
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
in this big world of ours,

84
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:26,040
half steps are the distance from one note to the next note,

85
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,510
wherever it is,

86
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,770
okay, just whatever the next frets were on a guitar,

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,530
one fret is a half step,

88
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,870
okay,

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,070
in a piano, if you wanted to put it with piano,

90
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,240
if you're on a piano,

91
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,260
hitting a note

92
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,340
and then the next key whether it's white or black, would be a half step,

93
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,970
just that distance from one note to the next note is a half step,

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,830
if I put two of those together,

95
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,390
I get a whole step.

96
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,950
So like if I'm down here,

97
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:03,580
the distance between a C and a D would be a whole step,

98
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,220
I'm covering a half step and then another half step,

99
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,510
so the distance from a C to a D would be a whole step,

100
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,140
an F to a G, that would be a whole step,

101
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,260
even when we use an open string,

102
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,530
there's still this one fret, in between between this G and A,

103
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,240
those would also be whole steps.

104
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,930
And half steps are between two pairs of notes,

105
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,340
this is very critical,

106
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,870
the only that, here's the rule,

107
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,830
the only naturally occurring half steps are between E and F and B and C,

108
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,370
naturally occurring, what I mean by that is,

109
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,050
there's no sharps or flats involved,

110
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,480
if we're not talking about sharps or flats at all,

111
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,560
we're just talking about,

112
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,040
just the notes C D E F G and A and B,

113
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,940
the only naturally occurring half steps are between two pairs of notes,

114
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,840
E and F, and B and C,

115
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,600
on our guitar be E to F and B to C,

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,130
now you may think that's not very important,

117
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,050
but here in a second it's gonna get real critical.

118
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,200
Let's learn the notes on the sixth string,

119
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,730
we already have open E,

120
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,620
we have first finger F,

121
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,320
we've got up here on the third fret G,

122
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,090
well, if I wanted to keep going higher,

123
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,070
the distance between a G to an A would be a whole step,

124
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,940
think of it this way,

125
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,160
everything is going to be a whole step, except for two pairs of notes,

126
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,720
E and F and B and C,

127
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,680
all the other ones without sharps or flats are going to be whole steps,

128
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,590
so a G to an A would be a whole step,

129
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,820
and A to a B would be another whole step,

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,370
now here I want to go to a C,

131
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,750
but the rule says,

132
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,000
between a B and C is a half step,

133
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,930
so that would just be one fret [], that would be C,

134
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,980
now we need to go from C to the next note which would be a D,

135
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,810
well, that's not one of our exceptions,

136
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,960
so that would be a whole step again,

137
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,340
D to E would be another whole step again,

138
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,890
let's do that again, you try it with me at home.

139
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,710
We have E F G,

140
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,170
then the next note would be A,

141
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,220
that would be a whole step up, that's the fifth fret,

142
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,230
next note would be a B,

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,710
that would be a whole step up, at the seventh fret

144
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,820
and then between B and C that's just a half step,

145
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,830
so that's at the eighth fret,

146
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,210
then D, a whole step above that at ten,

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,990
and D to E would be our last one up here

148
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,340
and that would be the twelfth fret.

149
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,800
Now let me tell you about the magical twelfth fret,

150
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,190
at the twelfth fret, everything starts repeating,

151
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,720
this would be E,

152
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,270
then you'd have F, just like this F,

153
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,050
then you'd have G, just like this G,

154
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,190
so just kind of keeps going,

155
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,470
E F G A B,

156
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,600
so really once you've got the first twelve,

157
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,400
you have the rest of the instrument there,

158
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,630
because it just keeps repeating.

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,390
Okay, let's do it one more time,

160
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:15,910
E F G A B C D E,

161
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,620
now let's go back down backwards,

162
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,320
okay, try and say and play the notes with me,

163
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:37,540
E D C B A G F E.

164
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,680
Very good, now, when I throw sharps or flats in it,

165
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,030
I just have to raise,

166
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,260
remember for whatever note is,

167
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,840
if I'm sharpening it, I go up one half step,

168
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,850
which would be one frets [worth],

169
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,560
so if I wanted a #G,

170
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,210
there would be a #G on the fourth fret,

171
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,890
if I wanted, let's say a #C,

172
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,240
that would be,

173
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,030
well, here C, I go a half step above that

174
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,190
and I get #G.

175
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,170
So now let's jump around a little bit,

176
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,910
I'm just gonna tell you a couple of them

177
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,130
and you try and find them, okay?

178
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,150
We'll start out with G,

179
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,710
there would be a G,

180
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,920
what about C, where would that be at,

181
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:31,610
counted out, E F G A B C, at the eighth fret,

182
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,900
what about F,

183
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,210
well, that was pretty easy, that's down here at the first,

184
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,040
one of the first things we learned,

185
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,620
what about a bB now,

186
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
well, here's a B, so there's a bB,

187
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,190
what about an bE,

188
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,900
well, go up to the twelfth fret,

189
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,650
that's E,

190
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,560
I can't get any lower down here to the opening,

191
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,360
so I've gotta go high,

192
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,100
if I can't go low, I've gotta go high,

193
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,560
there's E, there's bE,

194
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,100
so there's some, there's some chance for you to practice in there.

195
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,100
Now, we need to get our first finger strong enough

196
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,260
to do some of the barre chords that are coming up here in a minute,

197
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,390
so let's talk about strengthening up our first finger.

198
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,550
Okay.

199
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,670
Many people say that barre chords,

200
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,720
they just don't do barre chords,

201
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,190
because barre chords are hard.

202
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,810
Well, barre chords aren't hard,

203
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,280
you are just weak,

204
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,780
especially your first finger,

205
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,520
well, at least your first finger is weak,

206
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,550
so we need to strengthen up that first finger a little bit,

207
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,110
before we get into barre chords,

208
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,090
so let's go up to here, the fifth fret,

209
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,070
okay,

210
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,090
and we'll put our first finger down

211
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,060
and we're going to cover three strings at a time,

212
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,680
just the bottom three strings,

213
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,600
okay, with our first finger,

214
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,010
play those,

215
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,310
I put it down, I gotta put a lot more pressure on this

216
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,850
and we play all three of them together,

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,660
ready, let's play,

218
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,110
now it may buzz a little bit

219
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,430
as your fingers getting used to,

220
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,670
strengthening up to do to play these barre chords,

221
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,630
but that's okay,

222
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,430
that's what we're trying to strengthen right now,

223
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
it takes a while to do this,

224
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,990
you may not be getting this the first time you do it,

225
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,620
it takes a while to get your fingers strengthened up enough

226
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,490
to do what we need to do,

227
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,470
so let's just go through a little exercise to help you,

228
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,360
make sure you have good hand position,

229
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,370
make sure that wrist is forward,

230
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,090
not back like this, but forward

231
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,620
and your finger is straight,

232
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,290
finger straight on the frets,

233
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,310
okay, make sure that first finger is dead straight,

234
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,040
not angling in a little bit like this,

235
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,570
I know you need pressure

236
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,490
and you want to bring that wrist up for pressure,

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,770
leave that wrist down for that,

238
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,480
okay, try not to buzz.

239
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,590
Let's go over the fifth, fifth fret, cover three strings,

240
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,370
okay, now let's take the whole picture down,

241
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,170
let's go down to the third fret,

242
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,980
so you can get those three,

243
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,350
good,

244
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,440
let's jump down to maybe the second fret,

245
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,010
the closer I get to this nut down here though,

246
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,300
it gets a little bit harder,

247
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,690
the easiest place to practice these barre chords in the middle of the neck

248
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,160
right here at the fifth or the seventh fret,

249
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,950
what about at the first fret,

250
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,030
can you get all those three to sound.

251
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,100
Okay, now let's do four strings,

252
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,410
okay, let's go back up here to the fifth fret

253
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,060
and now we're going to do four strings,

254
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,360
okay, trying to get those to sound,

255
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,650
let's go up, maybe the seventh fret,

256
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,940
let's go up a little bit more, what about if the ninth fret here.

257
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,150
Good, alright, now let's kick it up a notch,

258
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,620
let's go to five strings,

259
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,480
okay, now you don't want your finger necessarily straight on the instrument like this,

260
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,430
you want it kind of angled a little bit,

261
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,670
I mean if you can kind of see where my finger,

262
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,480
the, the notches in my finger,

263
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,080
where the strings are really on this last quarter of my finger,

264
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,550
so I'm not necessarily dead on,

265
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,020
I'm kind of offset a little bit.

266
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,840
Let's go over here to the third fret and do the same thing,

267
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,530
remember a good good finger position,

268
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,240
if I'm hugging up right behind the fret,

269
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,510
that's the easiest place for me to get the notes to sound,

270
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,010
requires the least amount of pressure,

271
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,210
okay, if I'm back here going to sound real buzzy.

272
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,160
Okay, let's go down to the first fret, it's pretty tough down there.

273
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,850
Okay, now let's go to all six, okay,

274
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,350
now you got a little, take a little practice

275
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,500
to figure out where you actually need to push that first finger down at,

276
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,410
it might help to actually overshoot,

277
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,640
you don't want to be just right here,

278
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,440
it helps to kind of overshoot a little bit,

279
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,650
I kind of overshoot it, I don't know maybe a half an inch or so,

280
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,160
so you can get all six strings,

281
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,900
each string to sound out of a clear sound,

282
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,610
let's go down to the third fret,

283
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,320
and eventually down to the first fret,

284
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,600
if you can conquer,

285
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,490
putting all the pressure that you need

286
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,840
to get that first fret, all six strings without buzzing,

287
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,060
you've got enough strength to do any barre chord, that I'm gonna be able to throw at you.

288
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,660
Okay, so you may not be able to do this initially,

289
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,030
so take a little bit of time each day,

290
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,100
strengthen up that first finger,

291
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,050
don't give up after the first time you do it,

292
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,990
it takes a little, it takes a little bit of time

293
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,670
over a couple of weeks maybe,

294
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,460
to get that first finger strengthened up enough.

295
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,800
Okay, ready to learn some barre chords,

296
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,030
let's go ahead and do that.

297
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,190
Okay, let's talk about five major chord forms,

298
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,140
that we're going to learn on that six string.

299
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,450
Okay, now you'll notice,

300
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,690
as we put up the first one, the F chord,

301
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,460
okay, that you're going,

302
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,220
there's a couple of new concepts that you're going to see on that chord block,

303
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,450
that you haven't seen before yet,

304
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,770
first one of them is a fret number,

305
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,130
okay, everything up to this point,

306
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,750
we've done down here in the first position,

307
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,150
but now you're gonna start seeing a fret number beside some of your chord forms,

308
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,970
which would be a 1fr.,

309
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,910
sometimes it may say 5fr.,

310
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,020
which would be like the fifth fret,

311
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,690
or the seventh fret, 7fr.,

312
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,730
that's just telling you the fret number that you're at.

313
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,770
Okay, the other thing is

314
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,410
you're going to see that big arc over the top of it,

315
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,390
that is the symbol for a barre,

316
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,600
that means everything that is covered there,

317
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,430
is being covered by that one finger,

318
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,680
sometimes that barre will be just two strings,

319
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,700
sometimes it'll be four,

320
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,440
in all of these that we're doing today,

321
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,970
it's going to be all six strings.

322
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,290
The last one, you'll notice there's a diamond,

323
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,840
we don't have just black circles and open circles,

324
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,160
now weve got a diamond in there,

325
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,410
that diamond is critical,

326
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,690
that's going to be the note that we're pivoting off of,

327
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,580
as we're moving these chords around,

328
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,110
we'll talk a little bit more about that later,

329
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,540
but that's the note that we're pivoting off of.

330
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,200
Okay, first we're going to learn is an F chord.

331
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,070
Okay, so let's see what we've got here,

332
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,900
on that chord block,

333
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,160
you'll notice the first, there's a barre over those six strings,

334
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,980
okay, so you get that happening first,

335
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,430
then you put your third finger on that fifth string F,

336
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,710
pinky underneath that,

337
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,140
and then that A is covered by the second finger on the third string,

338
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,060
that's an F chord.

339
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,560
Let's try one more time,

340
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,260
make sure each note is sounding out nice and clearly,

341
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,390
again, it takes a while to get this,

342
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,560
so if you don't get it the first time,

343
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,340
don't give up,

344
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,140
it takes a while to strengthen your muscles,

345
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,830
the only difference between this and this is hand strength,

346
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,140
I didn't move the position of my fingers at all,

347
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,090
so if your chord sounds more like this,

348
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,000
all it takes is a little bit more hand strength to get it

349
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,170
and you'll be doing it,

350
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,730
okay, there's an F.

351
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,330
Now, the next form, we're going to learn is

352
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,760
an F minor, Fm you'll see,

353
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,470
then I just take my second finger off,

354
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,010
and I've got an Fm.

355
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,500
Next one is an F7,

356
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,120
I put my second finger back on,

357
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,800
I take my pinky off

358
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,010
and that's an F7.

359
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,290
The fourth one down there

360
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,470
or the fourth one we're going to cover is an Fm7,

361
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,580
I take my second finger off and my pinky off.

362
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,300
And then the last one is an Fsus,

363
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,130
which I put my pinky back on,

364
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,680
except this time I put him down on the third string.

365
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,910
Okay, so those are the five chord forms that we're going to talk about.

366
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,150
Okay.

367
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,110
Now, let's talk about moving those chord forms,

368
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,860
if you look at the first example in your book,

369
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,840
you've got an F chord,

370
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,940
so for, let's form an F chord

371
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,520
and then it goes up to a G chord,

372
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,250
well, here's where the pivoting comes in place,

373
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,260
remember how I taught you half steps and whole steps

374
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,600
and learning what notes they are on the sixth string,

375
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,490
if I take this F chord,

376
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,630
where's the F in this F chord,

377
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,780
as far as a six string is concerned,

378
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,700
it's right here, on my first finger,

379
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,120
if I move my first finger to where G is

380
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,490
and now form the exact same chord,

381
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,340
I've got A G chord,

382
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,380
see how that works,

383
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,080
the next measure has an A chord,

384
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,470
well, again I put my first finger where the A is

385
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,000
and then form the chord down I've got A.

386
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,410
Next one is a bB,

387
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,630
I go up here to bB,

388
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,610
I do the whole chord.

389
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,380
So if I was doing all that together,

390
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,970
it would be like this,

391
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,620
ready play,

392
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,610
F, two three four,

393
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,200
then move up to G, two three four,

394
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,370
A, two three four

395
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,660
and bB, two three four,

396
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,620
very good.

397
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,900
Okay, now let's move on to the next one,

398
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,820
just, just between a couple of these forms,

399
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,900
we've got, it starts out on a G,

400
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,920
we find our G, we make our chord,

401
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,470
okay, then it goes to Am,

402
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,830
so we have to go up here to A,

403
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,600
form Am chord,

404
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,950
and it goes to Bm

405
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,490
and C.

406
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,320
Okay, very good,

407
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,500
that gives some idea of barre chords

408
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,460
and how you move them.

409
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,120
Now it's going to take you a while to get these,

410
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,560
so I know I ran through pretty quick,

411
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,110
that's why the workshop time is going to start paying off here,

412
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,560
now let's learn a little bit about music in our how music works section.

413
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,810
Okay, welcome to our how music works section,

414
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,670
learning a little bit about music and a little bit how music fits together

415
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,720
is one of the most important skills that you can learn as a guitar player.

416
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,230
So maybe thinking, gosh, just teach me a couple of chords

417
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,310
and I'm ready to go,

418
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,390
well, that's maybe the learn part of the learn and master guitar,

419
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,300
but the part of when you get into the master part of it,

420
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,100
you need to learn a little bit about music

421
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,850
and about how music affects your playing as a guitar player,

422
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,460
so we're going to take a second to learn a little bit about that.

423
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,120
The road to all, learning how chords are spelled what notes

424
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,950
and how we can move those chords around,

425
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,020
it all starts with major scales

426
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,130
and major scales are built up of half steps and whole steps,

427
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,100
we talked about half steps a little bit previously,

428
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:49,960
okay, half step is distance between one note and his immediate neighbour,

429
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,920
okay, I get two half steps, I put them together, I get a whole step,

430
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,840
right, remember the rule,

431
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:02,360
the only naturally occurring half steps are between E and F and B and C,

432
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,090
the only naturally occurring half steps are between E and F and B and C.

433
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,970
Okay, but when we start to add things in here,

434
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,130
you need to keep track of those sharps and flats,

435
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,760
as you'll see,

436
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,180
okay, so if the distance between F and G is a whole step,

437
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,920
then the distance from an #F to #G is also a whole step,

438
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,600
if an F to G is a whole step,

439
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,790
an #F to #G is a whole step.

440
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,160
Okay, see how that works,

441
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,930
let's do a couple of examples real quick,

442
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,680
what's the distance from a #C to a D,

443
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,930
now, if you want to play this on your guitar,

444
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,920
that's fine too,

445
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,330
if you want to think about it in music,

446
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,980
which is what we're going to put on the screen,

447
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,590
I want you to think about in music notation too,

448
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,280
because this is true,

449
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,060
no matter whether you're playing a guitar or piano or trumpet or tuba.

450
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,810
Okay, the distance between a #C and D is a half step,

451
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,790
a C to a D is a whole step,

452
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,100
I've moved that C closer to the D,

453
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,040
now, #C to a D is just a half step.

454
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,160
Okay.

455
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,490
What is the distance from an bE to an F,

456
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,600
think about that for a second,

457
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,240
an bE to an F,

458
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,880
if E and F is a half step,

459
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,340
then if I scoot that E farther from that F a half step,

460
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,290
then it becomes an bE

461
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,270
and that then becomes a whole step,

462
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,460
so an bE to an f is a whole step.

463
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,170
What about the distance from a G to an bA,

464
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,940
well, G to an A is a whole step,

465
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,880
if I scoot that A closer down to that G,

466
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,500
it becomes just a half step,

467
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,080
so a G to an bA is a half step.

468
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,320
Now let's talk about major scales,

469
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,860
everything that we're talking about from this point on,

470
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,440
all the theory, all the harmony stuff,

471
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,720
what notes you can add the chords to sound hip and and colorful in your sound,

472
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,660
it is all based off of one thing, major scales,

473
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,270
okay, major scales are the building blocks for all of music

474
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,190
and they are built from a specific pattern of half steps and whole steps,

475
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,870
it's like math, it's like a formula,

476
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,590
I know many of you math may not have been your best subject,

477
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,900
but music has a lot to do with math,

478
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,200
in fact some, many studies have found that,

479
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,750
if you have a student that's struggling in math,

480
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,920
if you teach the music,

481
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,520
something about the order and the presentation of the music helps them in their math skills,

482
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,520
so something about that in our brains,

483
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,910
connects the two together in the same way we process the information.

484
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,150
Okay, major scales are built from a pattern,

485
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,210
it's a pattern of half steps and whole steps,

486
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,170
you're ready for the pattern,

487
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,800
here it is,

488
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,050
the pattern for a major scale is

489
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:54,150
whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step,

490
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,250
okay, so it's two whole steps and half step, three whole steps and half step,

491
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,270
that's how a major scale is made,

492
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,650
you start on any note,

493
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,100
whether it's F or G or bB or bG,

494
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,760
you start on that note and you build up,

495
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,290
just like in building blocks,

496
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,280
half step, or you building the half step whole step pattern,

497
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,680
two wholes and a half, three wholes and a half

498
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,660
and you end up with the major scale.

499
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,480
Let's try this a little bit,

500
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,660
let's start in C,

501
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,870
okay, so if I have a C major scale,

502
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,300
C, I start on a C,

503
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,850
then the pattern says, I need to go up a whole step,

504
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,640
the distance from a C to a D is a whole step,

505
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,020
so I would just go right up to D,

506
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,110
then I need another whole step,

507
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,690
a D to an E is a whole step,

508
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,880
then I need a half step, the pattern says,

509
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,700
E to an F conveniently is a half step,

510
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,440
next one I need a whole step,

511
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,270
whole step up from an F would be a G,

512
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,910
whole step up from a G would be an A,

513
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,400
whole step up from an A would be a B,

514
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,860
and then I have a half step at the end

515
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,600
and which gets me back to C,

516
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,180
your first and your last note should always match,

517
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,550
okay, if you get to the end of some of these exercises in,

518
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,900
your first and last note don't match,

519
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,790
somewhere you screwed up along the way,

520
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,830
the first and last note should always match,

521
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,500
two wholes and a half, three wholes and a half.

522
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,440
Okay, now as you go through different notes,

523
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,020
you need to edit the sharps and flats,

524
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,720
you need to adjust those sharps and flats,

525
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,610
in order to make the pattern work out right,

526
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,800
okay, so we can get the pattern of half steps and whole steps to make a major scale,

527
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,260
now when you're spelling scales,

528
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,720
all of the notes need to be consecutive,

529
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,580
what do I mean by that,

530
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,460
you can't jump from a #C to an E,

531
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,820
I gotta have a note in between,

532
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,570
it has to go A B C D E F G,

533
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,630
I can't jump from a C,

534
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,810
no matter whether it's a #C to an bE,

535
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,150
it doesn't, in in music theory that doesn't work,

536
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,810
you can't do that,

537
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,520
I have to go from some kind of a C,

538
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,650
no matter how bad I have to sharp or flat it

539
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,270
to some kind of a D,

540
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,940
no matter bad, no matter how much I have to sharp or flat,

541
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,930
in order for it to work.

542
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,190
Okay, let's try a couple of one,

543
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,570
let's try a scale,

544
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,450
that was going to include some sharps or flats in it,

545
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,770
let's try an f scale.

546
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,260
Okay, we're going to an F major scale,

547
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,120
you just think with me, we start on F,

548
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,070
and we need a whole step,

549
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,230
whole step up from an F is a G,

550
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,930
and we need another whole step,

551
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,760
whole step up from G is an A,

552
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,970
now I need a half step,

553
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,780
here's the trick

554
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,730
and A to a B as a whole step,

555
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,280
so I've got to squeeze that B down a half step,

556
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,610
to get it, to work out in our pattern right,

557
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,170
whole whole half,

558
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,280
so it would be F G A and now bB.

559
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,470
Okay, now I need to go a whole step up,

560
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,630
but I'm going a whole step up from a bB,

561
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,720
so that would be C,

562
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,670
if a B to a C is just a half step,

563
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,880
a bB to a C now would be a whole step,

564
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,550
and a whole step up from a C is a D,

565
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,380
whole step up from a D is an E,

566
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,410
now I'm back to half step, E to an F,

567
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,090
my first and last notes match,

568
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,800
I've got an F major scale,

569
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,270
F G A bB C D E F.

570
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,280
Okay, there are much more exercise,

571
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,410
there are many more exercises in your book

572
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,200
to get you a lot of good practice on major scales,

573
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,830
it's not just about spelling them once, it's about learning,

574
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,570
it's kind of like your multiplication tables,

575
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,390
you're eventually gonna have to learn all these scales,

576
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,880
now you may think there's no way I could learn all these scales,

577
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,260
it's not like there's a hundred of them,

578
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,860
there's only twelve different notes on your guitar before they start repeating,

579
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,990
so there's only twelve different major scales,

580
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,780
it's not an unknowable amount of information,

581
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,400
it's actually a pretty relatively easy amount of information,

582
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,410
but it is going to take more than just doing it once,

583
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,570
so you need to do them over and over and over again,

584
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,640
that's why we give you plenty of exercises to do that.

585
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,210
Okay, so memorize which scales have which sharps and flats,

586
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,710
that will be a good place for you to start.

587
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,150
Learning how to build scales is one of the most important things you can do for your musicianship,

588
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,490
it may be a little technical right now,

589
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,170
that this is going to start paying off,

590
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,440
when we start going beyond what the average guitar player can do,

591
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,730
most every guitar player that you run across can do C and G,

592
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,010
well, we're moving beyond C and G now,

593
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,590
we're moving down to playing bA and bG

594
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,970
and knowing what chords go with what.

595
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,780
Okay, so if you're finding it,

596
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,820
where we're going a little bit past you,

597
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,310
go back and review some of the earlier exercises

598
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,880
and we can, get yourself up on those skills,

599
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,760
when we're, now we're building scales, we're ready to go.

600
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,220
Let's talk about our assignment for this week or for this session,

601
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,570
let's take a look at our assignment.

602
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,810
Your assignment for this session is

603
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:45,860
to practice saying and playing the notes on the sixth string

604
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,360
ascending and descending,

605
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,260
remember how we did that,

606
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:52,130
E F G A B C D E

607
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,820
and then I want to say and play them down, E D C B,

608
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,500
okay, all the way down.

609
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,820
Memorize the five six string barre forms that we talked about,

610
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:09,020
F, Fm, Fm7, F7 and Fsus,

611
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,020
okay, do those fingering strengthening exercises,

612
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:18,320
if you're having problems getting the barres down to be a strong enough,

613
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,170
okay, try not to get any buzzes or miss notes,

614
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,890
okay, play through the six string barre chord exercises in your book,

615
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,950
play through the song that we have in our book.

616
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,790
And for our how music work section,

617
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,940
fill out the major scale worksheets in the book,

618
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,310
using the major scale pattern that we talked about,

619
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,320
that's a lot of material for this time,

620
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,450
but I know you're gonna get it, keep working at it,

621
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,770
I'll see you at the workshop time.

622
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,250
Hi, welcome to session seven the workshop time,

623
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,350
you're ready to work out all the things we learn,

624
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,160
here we go,

625
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,630
first thing we need to talk about is,

626
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,000
we're going to jump around on that six string,

627
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,020
you jump with me,

628
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,320
play a G on that six string,

629
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,380
okay, what about a C,

630
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,080
where would that be,

631
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:21,080
it's counted up, E F G A B C,

632
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,280
let's do that,

633
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,770
let's go, we're gonna count them all the way up and all the way down,

634
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:44,110
okay, here we starts on the E F G A B C D E,

635
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,430
magical twelve fret, okay a lot of guitars have a double dot right there,

636
00:30:48,730 --> 00:31:04,780
going back down, D C B A G F E.

637
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,840
Let's jump around, find a G,

638
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,830
find a C,

639
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,890
what about an F,

640
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,920
bB,

641
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,170
bE, remember you can't go low so you gotta go high,

642
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,320
twelve fret E, bE,

643
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,130
bA,

644
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,100
#C,

645
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,600
#F,

646
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:44,890
B,

647
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,720
E,

648
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,560
open E, of course twelve fret,

649
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,280
A,

650
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
D,

651
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,310
and we're back to C.

652
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,130
Very good,

653
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,430
all right now, remember our five forms that we've learned,

654
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,990
we've learned F,

655
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,600
take that second finger off, Fm,

656
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,840
F7,

657
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,720
Fm7,

658
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,710
Fsus.

659
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,290
Okay, remember to have good form,

660
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,440
lower that wrist, lots of air space in between that,

661
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,090
keep that first finger straight,

662
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,950
if you need to strengthen up that first finger,

663
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,840
take a few seconds, a few minutes to do our finger strengthening exercise, to do that,

664
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,220
we're going to go ahead and move on,

665
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,200
but if you need to strengthen that first finger,

666
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,240
do that,

667
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,670
and come back to us.

668
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,660
Okay, let's start the basic barre chord exercises,

669
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,860
number one,

670
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,560
ready play,

671
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,010
two three four,

672
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,520
two three four,

673
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,670
repeat it, back down to F.

674
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,480
Number two, G,

675
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,790
ready, let's do this one slow

676
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,590
and then we'll play it speed up,

677
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,390
one time slow, one time fast,

678
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,280
G, number two, go,

679
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,740
one two, another one,

680
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,530
Am,

681
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,650
Bm,

682
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,400
C.

683
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,460
And now let's play a little faster,

684
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,230
ready go,

685
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,660
G,

686
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,500
Am

687
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,470
try not to hesitate between chords,

688
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:11,750
Bm.

689
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's skip down and do number four,

690
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,970
number four starts on a bB major,

691
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,580
you ready, got it,

692
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,880
first time slow,

693
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,000
ready, play,

694
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,010
Cm,

695
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,630
F7,

696
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,240
big jump down to F7,

697
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,220
Gm,

698
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,360
Cm,

699
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,920
Fsus,

700
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,540
F7,

701
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,680
bB.

702
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,480
Good,

703
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,150
now, let's try number six,

704
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,740
to close this section off.

705
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,500
Okay, number six starts on a G,

706
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,690
ready, go,

707
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,200
two,

708
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,610
Bm,

709
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,680
big jump up to Bm,

710
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,970
C,

711
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,440
back to Bm,

712
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,480
try not to hesitate between chords,

713
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,090
Am,

714
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,230
big jump down to F,

715
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,400
#F,

716
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:59,910
two three four.

717
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:00,870
Very good,

718
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,930
okay, now let's look at the song, that we have in our book,

719
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,420
Home On The Range.

720
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,130
Okay, since three four time,

721
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,040
let's do the single notes first

722
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,750
and then we'll work on the chords

723
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,280
and I want you to play those chords,

724
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,170
even though a lot of them are open chords,

725
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,110
I want you to try and play as many of them as you can, as a barre chord,

726
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,420
the idea to strengthen up that hand.

727
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,110
Okay, let's do the single notes first,

728
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:32,630
okay, ready, go,

729
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,440
eighth notes,

730
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,770
the tie over, three, one two,

731
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,960
one two,

732
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:07,040
dotted quarter,

733
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,410
two three, one,

734
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,270
next part, G, two three,

735
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:26,970
two three, one two,

736
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:33,750
two three, one two,

737
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:51,080
two three, one two three.

738
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,690
Good, now let's go through the barre chords on it,

739
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,900
okay, when should start on that C,

740
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,160
okay,

741
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,990
the C, where would that C major be,

742
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,260
well, F G A B C,

743
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,340
the first chord is a C major,

744
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,060
then it would be a C major again in the next measure,

745
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,130
even though it's not written,

746
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,870
then it goes to an F major,

747
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,470
you gotta jump all the way down to F,

748
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,900
another F,

749
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,390
back to C,

750
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,150
another C,

751
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,580
here comes a G7,

752
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:32,160
jump down to G get the seventh form, two three,

753
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,620
backup to C, two three,

754
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,280
F, go, two three,

755
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,080
back to C,

756
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,600
you get a lot of good practice jumping,

757
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,470
two three, two three,

758
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,240
here go to the next part G,

759
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,720
G7 now take that pinky off,

760
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,380
C,

761
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,950
Am,

762
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,600
D7, way up here at the top,

763
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,370
and G,two three,

764
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,060
G7,

765
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:20,900
C,

766
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,680
back to F,

767
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,930
Fm there you go,

768
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,740
C,

769
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,900
G7,

770
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,690
back to C,

771
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,330
two three, one two three.

772
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,150
Very good, good workout on our hands,

773
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,040
your hands probably pretty sore about now,

774
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,710
I think I might do my little finger exercise here

775
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,400
to strengthen up, to loosen up that hand a bit after doing all that.

776
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,790
Okay, barre chords take consistent practice,

777
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,110
we haven't had a,

778
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,250
it's been a few sessions

779
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,990
since we've actually had to deal with something physical, a physical issue

780
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,270
and getting your hand strengthened up enough

781
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,310
to do barre chords is a physical thing

782
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,470
and it takes time for the average student

783
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,210
to get these barre chords down,

784
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,310
like you need to it takes about three weeks,

785
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,330
so don't feel discouraged,

786
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,550
if I'm running through real quick

787
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,230
and you don't get them in the first ten minutes,

788
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,970
it takes about three weeks

789
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,410
have given about five or ten minutes each day to toughen up that finger

790
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,210
and get him strong enough to do what he needs to,

791
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,190
you can't just do it for a couple hours

792
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,530
and be there generally takes a little bit longer than that,

793
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,180
so don't be discouraged, when you do that.

794
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,340
Okay, now let's talk about major scales,

795
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,200
remember our major scale,

796
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,840
it is pattern of half steps and whole steps,

797
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,860
what's the pattern,

798
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,860
two wholes and a half,

799
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,330
whole whole half,

800
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,340
then three wholes and a half,

801
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,460
whole, whole step, whole step, half,

802
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,980
put that all together,

803
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,110
whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step,

804
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,160
let's play or let's spell it in G,

805
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,150
if we were in G,

806
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,030
G, now I need a whole step, that's A,

807
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,400
now need another whole step, B,

808
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,840
now I need a half step, C,

809
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,720
I need a whole step, now, D,

810
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,120
I need another whole step, E

811
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,490
and now I need a third whole step,

812
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,040
which that's going to make that an #F,

813
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,700
E to #F

814
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,910
and then I need a half step at the end, #F to G,

815
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:44,880
so G scale is G A B C D E #F G,

816
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,150
we learn about keys and key signatures next time,

817
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,240
but that #F is telling you some very important information,

818
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,490
in the key of G, we have an #F.

819
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,690
Let's do one more,

820
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,670
let's spell a bB scale,

821
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,390
starts on a bB,

822
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,370
then I need a whole step above a bB, should be C,

823
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,520
I need another whole step, D,

824
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:12,260
now I need a half step, up from a D, that would be an bE,

825
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,800
so far, I've got bB C D bE,

826
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,440
now I need a whole step, to an F,

827
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,760
another whole step, to a G,

828
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,470
another whole step, the third whole step, that would be to an A,

829
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,420
and then our half step at the end,

830
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,130
gets us back to bB where we started,

831
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,080
so bB scale is

832
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:42,580
bB C D bE F G A bB.

833
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,640
I would encourage you to spell the scales that we have in the worksheets there,

834
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,050
if you haven't done so already,

835
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,310
once you've done them,

836
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,710
it's not like you've solved the problem,

837
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,410
once you do go back and do them again,

838
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,780
so write down, I would write down on a piece of paper,

839
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:01,940
C F, all the different keys should have twelve of them by the time you're done

840
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,280
and then write out those major scales again

841
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,890
and write them out again and write them out again

842
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:12,020
until you can memorize that bB scale has bB and bE in it,

843
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,470
and a G scale has an #F in it,

844
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,230
now it may seem like a lot of information

845
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,640
and it is a lot of information,

846
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,340
but it's like your multiplication tables,

847
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,110
you just kind of have to memorize them,

848
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,360
because where we're going, it's going to take,

849
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,530
you're going to need that information quickly and readily,

850
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,670
so I encourage you to,

851
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,100
if you need to stop everything now,

852
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,300
don't go on,

853
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,330
until you memorize those scales,

854
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,720
and what sharps and flats go with those,

855
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,580
we'll talk more about the keys next time,

856
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,620
it's very hard work added,

857
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,200
but you can do it,

858
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,850
learning music is a big task

859
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:52,020
and not very many people delve into actually understanding what they're playing,

860
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,410
that's what separates the average player from going beyond average,

861
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,360
so I'm glad you've chosen to do that,

862
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,590
so we'll see you next time.
