00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,100
Hi, welcome to session 15,

2
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,580
in this session, we're going to cover different types of electric guitars,

3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,490
we're going to talk about how pickups work, power chords

4
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,420
and how to use them,

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,840
this is all about electric guitars and the heart of rock and roll.

6
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,310
We're going to learn about other styles though too,

7
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,990
learn about country guitar playing,

8
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,220
it about Chicken Pickin

9
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,680
and a little bit about R&B stuff,

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,480
a little about funk guitar playing as well.

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,890
In the guitar tips section,

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,230
we're going to cover using guitar effects,

13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,980
distortion, reverb, chorus, delays,

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,780
a little bit about [amps and amp] modeling,

15
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,530
we've got a lot to cover,

16
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,490
so let's get started.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,060
Okay, the first thing I wanted to talk about is

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,590
a couple of different types of guitars,

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,080
that are mainly used in electric work.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,060
Okay, there's three basic styles,

21
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,470
a little variations in them,

22
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,700
but here are the basic styles,

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,940
this is a strato, regular Fender Stratocaster,

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,110
different guitar makers make them,

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,610
Fender is the one that started it

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,160
and its unique body design,

27
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,170
and it use single coil pickups,

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,910
it's real good for pop things,

29
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,310
get a little bit of a sweeter sound with a single coil sound,

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,810
a little bit of a smaller sound,

31
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,030
but very articulate and dynamic,

32
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,230
that's a strato.

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,390
Okay, now we've got a telecaster,

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,980
this is telecaster,

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,280
is a little bit,

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,110
notice the body shape is a little bit different,

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,000
still has the cut away here at the bottom,

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,250
but the body shape is a little bit different,

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,920
they're generally a little bit heavier than a strato as well,

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,230
although it depends on what type of wood is used,

41
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,180
the weight of it,

42
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,080
the thing that affects what your sound is going to be mainly your pickups

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,340
a little bit of what your strings are,

44
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,070
everything else, what type of wood, this is made out of,

45
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,650
whether you have gold or silver tuners at the top,

46
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,320
really doesn't mean anything with how your guitar is going to sound,

47
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,150
anyway, this is a good telecaster,

48
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,620
telecasters are used almost exclusively for country guitar playing,

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,310
a lot for good Blues,

50
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,320
a lot for good rock and roll,

51
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,630
this is a good lead kind of guitar,

52
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,700
a little bit on the harsher side of things,

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,890
can get real warm and fuzzy with them,

54
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,170
but these are just good for good rock and roll stuff,

55
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,430
now let's talk about one more.

56
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,880
Okay, the third guitar I want to talk about is 335,

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,380
Gibson ES-335,

58
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,250
Gibson puts them out,

59
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,150
but Epiphone and many other manufacturers come out with this body style as well,

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
it's a semi hollow body guitar,

61
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,420
what that means is that it does have an opening in the cavity right here,

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,260
so you can hear it a little bit without amplification,

63
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,700
let me turn my volume off here,

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
you can't hear very well,

65
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,520
but there is a little bit of sound there,

66
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,430
now it uses these big pickups here,

67
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,690
these big humbucking pickups,

68
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,250
we're going to learn what those are here in a second,

69
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:28,720
but it's get a real good Jazz, Jazz kind of song,

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,270
use a lot for Blues playing, BB King uses this,

71
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,300
and it really good for Jazz as well,

72
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,490
you can do a lot of good styles with it,

73
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,770
that's mainly used for Jazz and Blues stuff.

74
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,510
Okay, let's talk about different kinds of pickups,

75
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,470
I chose this guitar,

76
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,920
because this guitar just happen to have a mishmash of all different kinds of pickups,

77
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,380
I thought we could get a good example of them.

78
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,570
First, let's talk about how pickups work,

79
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,620
what are pickups,

80
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,680
well, various styles and shapes on guitars,

81
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,440
but here's the three pickups that I have on this telecaster,

82
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,570
now I'm going to talk about this one first,

83
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,010
because it's a little bit easier to see,

84
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,260
all the pickup is a magnet,

85
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,300
it's kind of just a [glorified] magnet,

86
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,270
you know when you have two magnets and you put them together,

87
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,130
you kind of feel that force between them,

88
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,110
that's all this is,

89
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,200
when I pluck this big metal string,

90
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,240
it is vibrating over the top of that,

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,220
if you can see that silver circle there,

92
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,680
that is actually the tip of a magnet,

93
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,080
okay, so if I play my string,

94
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,470
over the top of that string, over the top of that pickup,

95
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,290
that magnet, it translates that into electricity,

96
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,270
goes through a little volume, a little bit of tone

97
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,780
and that's basically your guitar,

98
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,930
there's not a whole lot of complex electronics on the inside of your guitar,

99
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,330
it's basically a couple of wires hooked up to these pickups.

100
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,650
But there's two different types of pickups, single coil and double coil.

101
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,910
Now really anything, that's metal vibrating over that pickup will work,

102
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,040
here I have my old tuning fork,

103
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,520
okay now when I get this going, it's vibrating,

104
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,080
and that pickup will sense that vibration as well,

105
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,620
guitar usually have a three way or a five way switch,

106
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,360
if I'm on the way up in front,

107
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,190
it's using the front pickup,

108
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,540
if I'm on the way in the back,

109
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,870
it's listening through this pickup, through the back pickup,

110
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,990
I'm in the middle, it's generally using this pickup.

111
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,520
Okay, now regarding pickups,

112
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,710
there's really only one type of pickup,

113
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,300
it's just basically this magnet,

114
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,150
now they wind different kinds of winding on it,

115
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,100
wind some more, wind some less,

116
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,160
but you'll hear single coil and double coil pickups,

117
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,090
basically all the double coil or humbucking pickup is

118
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,630
basically two single coils side-by-side or inverted,

119
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,510
you can imagine one is like this and the other one would be down like this.

120
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,470
Okay, now the single coil pickups are great,

121
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,810
they just we found out over the years,

122
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,070
that they're a little bit noisy,

123
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,410
so when you get two of them,

124
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,450
that's why they put these humbucking pickups,

125
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,730
they found out if you invert them,

126
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,470
then they get a quieter signal,

127
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,820
so that's the difference between the two,

128
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,500
they get a slightly difference in sound,

129
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,450
but it's basically the same thing,

130
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,640
just one of them is two of them and one of them is one of them.

131
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,420
Okay, now let's talk about power chords,

132
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,200
okay, good all rock and roll stuff involves power chords,

133
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,290
okay, here's what is involved in a power chord,

134
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,480
you may hear that term referred to a lot

135
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,160
and for a lot of many years,

136
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,140
I didn't know what in the word, they were talking about,

137
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,020
basically it's derived from the major scale,

138
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,780
remember how our major triad was 1 3 and 5,

139
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,690
on a power chord, we take out the third

140
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,940
and so you're just left with the root and the fifth,

141
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,600
in C, it would be a C and a G

142
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,400
and I play those at the same time,

143
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,580
let me check my distortion there,

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,440
a C and G,

145
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,480
if I'm in b flat, it would be a B flat and an F,

146
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,470
the root and the fifth in that particular key,

147
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,030
now sometimes you'll even have a chord form,

148
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,850
I'll have the octave down here on this C as well,

149
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,410
so you'll see it as a three note chord

150
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,030
or sometimes you'll see it as a two note chord,

151
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,610
it's a three note chord, I use all three,

152
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,700
it's a two note chord I just used two,

153
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,630
either way is fine,

154
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,340
either way or both power chords,

155
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,210
okay, but you're only using two different tones, the root, and the fifth,

156
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,230
okay, most power chords are based off of pivoting off of the fifth string,

157
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,580
as in this one C B flat

158
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,200
or you can also do it off the six string, F and G

159
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,750
and very conveniently, it works out to be the same form.

160
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,480
Okay, let's practice jumping through a little bit of that,

161
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,720
let's start on the sixth string power chord movable form first,

162
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,850
okay, this would be like an F power chord,

163
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,480
now what do you do with these other three strings,

164
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,620
well you're not supposed to play them,

165
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,080
either kind of mute them down here,

166
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,020
or you can mute them with this hand as well,

167
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,670
using this finger putting it down,

168
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,380
but basically you just try and keep a hand on not going too far down

169
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,970
and not playing these extra strings,

170
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,920
so this is an F power chord.

171
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,700
Okay, now let's jump around a little bit,

172
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,470
if I wanted it in G,

173
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,000
I pivot up to the third fret and play it in G,

174
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,010
if I wanted it in c,

175
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,760
I have to jump all the way up here to C

176
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,490
and play it in C,

177
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,450
see how that works,

178
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,590
let's do a couple more,

179
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,940
D,

180
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,900
let's do A.

181
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,510
Now, if I want to do it on the fifth string,

182
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,650
let's do it on the fifth string,

183
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,400
this would be like your B power chord version,

184
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,840
okay, same form I got one third and fourth right there,

185
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,000
let's jump around a little bit,

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,890
what if I wanted it in E,

187
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,090
I have to jump all the way up here,

188
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:06,350
what about, let's see G, up there,

189
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,060
what if I want to G on the other string,

190
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,140
be down there.

191
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,170
Okay, now let's do some exercises with them.

192
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,470
Okay, now that we've practiced jumping in a couple of different places with them,

193
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,410
let's do our power chord exercise number one.

194
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,690
Okay, starts off on a C chord,

195
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,740
sometimes you'll also see it written in notation as a C5,

196
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,890
as opposed to a C7 or Cm or something like that,

197
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,030
you'll see it as a C5,

198
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,800
that's trying to tell you, it's a power chord.

199
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,960
Okay, so let's look at that first example,

200
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,750
I'll do it for one time through nice and slowly.

201
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,180
One, two, ready, go,

202
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:50,350
then I shift on B flat,

203
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,600
then I do F,

204
00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:08,680
rest,,

205
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,610
see how that works,

206
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,210
we're just jumping from chord to chord using the same form again,

207
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,230
I'm a guitar player,

208
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,880
I like the simplest way of doing things,

209
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,760
that's why guitar players love power chords,

210
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,440
we don't have to worry about major minor or anything,

211
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,340
we just have to do,

212
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,040
we just have do them on the fifth or the fourth string,

213
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,420
fifth of the six string

214
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,950
and do that power chord form.

215
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,750
Okay, let's do one more example,

216
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,260
before we do that,

217
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,450
there are some open power chords,

218
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,330
I've taught you the movable ones on the fifth string, on the sixth string,

219
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,920
now let's look at an open one,

220
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,810
if I want an E power chord,

221
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,320
it would just be open E,

222
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,300
and it be an E,

223
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,000
which, if you can see,

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,280
if I moved everything up a half step,

225
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,360
there would be my F,

226
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,460
so it's really the same chord,

227
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,230
we just have it in open form,

228
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,230
the other one is an A,

229
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,970
okay, and again I could do all three strings or just two,

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,230
whatever I want to do on that,

231
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,530
okay, let's look at power chord exercise number three

232
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,700
and go through that one together.

233
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,190
Okay, starts on an E,

234
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,340
let's play it using our movable chords first

235
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,140
and then we'll play it using our open chords.

236
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,140
I'll go nice and slow,

237
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,050
one two three four,

238
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,360
rest, rest,

239
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,120
rest, rest,

240
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,390
rest, rest rest,

241
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,340
one two three,

242
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,380
two three,

243
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,090
to an A.

244
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,500
Now, let's play some open ones,

245
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,100
here we go,

246
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:44,210
one two three, two three, or A,

247
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,870
okay, now if I sped it up a little bit,

248
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,950
it comes out sounding something like this,

249
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:55,430
three,

250
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,180
two three four.

251
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,300
So you, you just have to keep track of which strings are being muted,

252
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,610
which strings you're picking aggressively down here.

253
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,020
Okay, now let's learn a little bit about some other styles of electric guitar playing.

254
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,880
Alright, now let's talk about some country styles,

255
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,970
okay, country, they use a lot of chicken pickin,

256
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,930
it's a funny name,

257
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,140
but basically here's, here's what all that I know about chicken pickin,

258
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,490
a lot of times they'll use a thumb pick

259
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,070
or they'll have real, they'll grow their nail along, a little bit longer on this hand,

260
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,340
so I'm using the thumb pick down here

261
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,850
and then I'm coming up with my first and second finger

262
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,010
or sometimes my third and fourth,

263
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,000
so you kind of get this,

264
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,510
you're playing generally two notes at once

265
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,730
or what's called in the [] double staff,

266
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,480
okay, they use a lot of bands and country music,

267
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,140
let me play that first lick I was playing again for you,

268
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:39,510
and I'll do it slow it down a little bit.

269
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,430
Okay, let's take that apart for a second,

270
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,290
let me slow it even further down,

271
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:52,770
we'll go real slow..

272
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,360
Okay, there's a whole bunch of combinations of techniques,

273
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,040
we've got some harmonized going in there,

274
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,920
we've got these two fingers plucking up with that,

275
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,170
that's all part of that chicken pickin style,

276
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,450
one of the best chicken pickin guys around,

277
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,070
with country guitar playing

278
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,890
is a wonderful guitarist, by the name of Brent Mason,

279
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,230
okay, he's playing on just about every country songs you hear on the radio these days,

280
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,210
doing that chicken pickin thing,

281
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,940
and there's all kinds of great [] that you can use for that,

282
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,590
that's just an example of one of them,

283
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,990
they also use a lot of bends,

284
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:30,180
let's see if I could do a bend to,

285
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,520
something like that,

286
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:45,130
or maybe I put them together,

287
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,750
something like that,

288
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,180
they also use arpeggios,

289
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,040
that use a lot of open strings,

290
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,150
I'm going to show you one

291
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,190
and I'll play it real slow for you.

292
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,100
Let's see if I can play a little bit faster.

293
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,270
As you as you learn these,

294
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,180
it takes a little bit of time to figure out these open strings,

295
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,980
but it's well worth it to get a few of these [] underneath your belt in your tool bag,

296
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,790
so when somebody says,

297
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,020
hey, can you play something country,

298
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,370
I don't know anything country,

299
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,210
but I can do this,

300
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,930
oh, we're in D,

301
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,450
I need to do in D, no problem,

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,800
country guitar playing is almost always done,

303
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,500
good guitar keys which is A D and E.

304
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,410
Good, now I want to talk about one more style of guitar playing,

305
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,340
a little bit about Rhythm and Blues, about R&B, funk guitar playing,

306
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,720
we talked about this a little bit,

307
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,520
when we're talking about muted picking,

308
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,640
but let me emphasize a couple of different things for you.

309
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,950
It's a real percussive style,

310
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,950
so you want to make sure you have a nice good thick pick

311
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,510
and as I'm playing,

312
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,700
let me kind of switch pickups here,

313
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,340
because I just play this A,

314
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,790
if I play hard enough,

315
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,480
I kind of get this popping sound,

316
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,480
so I'm just playing.

317
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,250
Okay, a little bit about Rhythm and Blues playing,

318
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,360
they use a lot of that,

319
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,590
instead of playing a full chord,

320
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,270
they'll just use a little bit part of a chord,

321
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,250
let only play one more example for you,

322
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,770
something like that,

323
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,540
they use a lot of [] muting,

324
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,270
a lot of taking the quarter part, we talked about earlier

325
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,600
and they used sliding of fourths and fifths,

326
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,340
which, if I'm in A, I just slide up,

327
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,620
kind of do it on the root,

328
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,180
then I do on the fifth,

329
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,580
they use that style a lot.

330
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay, now let's talk a little bit about guitar effects,

331
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,220
electric guitar players use them all the time,

332
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,890
there's basically some basic common ones,

333
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,050
that are similar between all different effect boards,

334
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,990
that you need to have in your [] to be able to get.

335
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,760
Okay, first thing I want to talk about is distortions,

336
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,780
okay, I've got several different distortions here on my pedal board,

337
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:46,440
[] if I [], this is kind of break up the sound a little bit,

338
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,690
some of them have different characteristics.

339
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,530
We switch over this one here,

340
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,370
that wants a little more softer and mellower,

341
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,590
use them differently in different situations,

342
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,830
let me talk to you about one specific type of pedal

343
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,870
and Ibanez Tube Screamer,

344
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,580
okay, this has been around for years

345
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,340
and probably will continue to be around for years and years and years,

346
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,300
now you'll notice distortion pedals have several things in common,

347
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,370
they have a drive,

348
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,080
and they also have a level knob

349
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,640
or sometimes you'll say it as gain,

350
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,800
think of it this way,

351
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,210
think of it like a water hose,

352
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,430
okay, the drive is what's your initial what's coming into the system,

353
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,770
and you can really boost that water hose,

354
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:41,640
okay, the one the level or the volume on is how much you're actually letting out of that big signal,

355
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,450
so I can control whether I'm having a little signal coming into the system

356
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,910
or a huge signal coming into the system,

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,830
but nothing comes out until I open the spigot on this end and let out whatever,

358
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,020
so if I have this huge signal coming here,

359
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,350
then I gotta make sure I have my volume down appropriately

360
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,420
are going to get this massive signal coming out,

361
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,280
so if I want to be really distorted,

362
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,140
I crank this gain all the way up,

363
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,840
get really distorted, really where it's really breaking up,

364
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,000
but I only want to allow a little bit of it out

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,950
or I'm going to have this too much of a massive signal,

366
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,640
it would be too loud,

367
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,290
if I just want a little bit of distortion,

368
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,850
or maybe I don't want distortion at all,

369
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,170
crank this down nice and low

370
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,180
and open this one up nice and big,

371
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,860
that's relationship between gain and volume.

372
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,710
Another pedal that is real common have is a chorus pedal,

373
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,580
what it's doing,

374
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,260
let me see if I can get a good chorus sound

375
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,460
here's my guitar normal,

376
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,010
if I had chorus,

377
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,970
chorus expand your sound a little bit,

378
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,960
now there's choruses and flangers and phase shifters,

379
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,340
they're all the same sort of thing,

380
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,300
it's taking your sound

381
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,820
and taking a little bit sharp, a little bit flat

382
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,200
and making it into a pleasant,

383
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,930
you can control how much it's diverting the sound or not.

384
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,660
Next thing everybody needs to have some sort of a delay,

385
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,670
Okay, I'm using a regular Boss digital delay,

386
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,100
here there's more exciting ones than this,

387
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,990
but basically they all kind of do the same thing,

388
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,250
I play my note,

389
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,350
and it fought trails off,

390
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,370
I can control how much it's feeding back,

391
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,520
how loud that needs to be,

392
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,320
I can make it feedback forever,

393
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,920
if I wanted.

394
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,650
And also when you do something like that,

395
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,820
you can get kind of neat effects.

396
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,590
Okay, so that's a little bit about reverb delays,

397
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,720
okay, reverb is more like an echo,

398
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,100
like you would hear in a room,

399
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,920
[] my reverb up,

400
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:07,380
kind of makes it sound like you're in a big place.

401
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,610
One talk about one more,

402
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,740
now I'm gonna use my waffle a little bit,

403
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,940
okay, okay, let's see what can I do,

404
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,510
a little bit about using your wah,

405
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,470
takes a while to get used to the feel of how that cycles through,

406
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,700
but it's a great effect,

407
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,350
especially in a funk playing,

408
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,780
you can get a lot of good use out of wah, okay.

409
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,240
Now, let's go to our how music works section.

410
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,380
Okay, very quickly,

411
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,420
I wanted to touch on a very important concept called the harmonized major scale,

412
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,650
not so important about the name,

413
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,740
but I want you understand the concept of what's going on,

414
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,240
if I take a major scale,

415
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,740
let's say a C major scale,

416
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,620
and I'm going to build things,

417
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm going to stack two-thirds above it,

418
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,510
so I actually have a major triad a one three and five,

419
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,440
then I stack thirds on all of those going all the way up the scale,

420
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,720
well the first step, if I do it in C,

421
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,620
it would be one three and five or C E and G,

422
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,520
which comes out to be a C major traid.

423
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,720
And the next one I would be two four and six,

424
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,420
which would be D F and A,

425
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,650
well now if you notice,

426
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,960
if you just look at that D F and A

427
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,000
and think of it in the key of D just for a second,

428
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,090
it doesn't turn out to be major turn out to be minor,

429
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,290
a one flat three and five,

430
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,030
if I'm looking at in the key of D,

431
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,990
it's very important,

432
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,350
the second step will get you a minor triad.

433
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,040
If I go to the next one,

434
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,450
I get E G and B,

435
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,900
okay, that also ends up being a minor triad.

436
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,550
The fourth, F A and C is back to major.

437
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,250
Fifth, back to major, G B and D.

438
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,150
Sixth, back to minor, A C and E.

439
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,500
Seventh, B D and F, actually ends up being a diminished triad,

440
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,660
if you look at it based off of that B.

441
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,990
This becomes real important,

442
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,810
some of them are major, some of them are minor,

443
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,370
in any key, any major key it's [] that same relationship,

444
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,590
which ones are major, the one chord, the four chord and the five chord,

445
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,790
which ones are minor, the two chord, the three chord, the six chord

446
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,270
and one that's off is the seventh, that's diminished,

447
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,820
that's a harmonized major scale concept,

448
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,780
very important,

449
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,880
I would practice that in different keys,

450
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,530
you can get an idea of how that flows,

451
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,120
one four and five major,

452
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,620
two three and six are minor.

453
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,970
Okay, let's talk about your assignment for this week,

454
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,960
I would like you to practice the power chords using good technique,

455
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,230
play the exercises and the song examples in your book,

456
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,460
work out the chicken pickin exercises, that are in there as well

457
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,900
and make some up on your own,

458
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,340
I would like you to practice the sliding fourth and fifth in various key combinations,

459
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,110
those exercise in your book as well,

460
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,850
and don't forget the Jam Along CDs,

461
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,400
give you plenty of opportunity to get some good practice

462
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,060
in power chords, sliding as well as the chicken pickin stuff.

463
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,830
Okay, we'll see at the workshop.

464
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,670
Okay, now it's our workshop time,

465
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,330
is the time where we work those concepts out that we've learned in session 15,

466
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,830
get them underneath our fingers.

467
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,990
Okay, let's review power chords,

468
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,080
remember we did them on the fifth string and the sixth string,

469
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,790
the fifth string version, if I wanted to do a B power chord,

470
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,790
you have your first finger, second fret,

471
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,070
third finger on the fourth fret,

472
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,750
pinky covering the third string, fourth fret,

473
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:53,630
okay, get a little [] sound here,

474
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,060
on the sixth string barre chord, like an F barre chord,

475
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,240
not barre chord, what am I talking about power chord, okay.

476
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,070
So let's jump around in some different places on those,

477
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,200
let's say I wanted a G power chord,

478
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,870
well, if I did it on the sixth string, it'd be like this,

479
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,300
what about if you did it on the fifth string,

480
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,060
what about a C power chord,

481
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,770
on both the sixth and fifth string,

482
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,660
sixth first, C,

483
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,270
fifth string.

484
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,430
What about E flat,

485
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,650
let's do E flat on both strings,

486
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,870
six strings to be way up here,

487
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,970
fifth string.

488
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,810
Make crank on some distortion here

489
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,430
switch to my [back],

490
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,650
pick up get a little more of a rock and roll sound,

491
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,120
let's do two more,

492
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,030
lets do a F,

493
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,340
six string,

494
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,980
fifth string.

495
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,030
would you like a B flat,

496
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,170
six string,

497
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,130
fifth string.

498
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,380
Power chord exercise number one, do it real slowly.

499
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:19,010
One, two ready go,

500
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,420
rest rest,

501
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,660
up be here,

502
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:32,930
back again again.

503
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,490
Good, now let's go power chord exercise number two,

504
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,690
we'll start this one pretty slow.

505
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:57,690
One, two ready go.

506
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,440
Let's skip down to power chord exercise number four,

507
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,280
we'll take it pretty slow,

508
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,520
one two three four.

509
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,870
One more time go.

510
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:01,020
Good, now let's talk about our chicken pickin exercise,

511
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,820
remember the [] that we learned,

512
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,860
let's do it nice and slow.

513
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,870
One two, ready, go.

514
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,200
Slow it down a bit more.

515
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,990
Now, if I wanted to do that E,

516
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,490
I moved the whole picture down here

517
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,010
and it's pretty much the same finger, finger pattern,

518
00:28:54,190 --> 00:29:04,000
in E, ready, go.

519
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,060
Now I can also do it in D,

520
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,560
let me just show that to you real quick,

521
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,400
I just have to adjust my fingers instead of being flat here on this,

522
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,110
partial barre with your first finger,

523
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm gonna use one and two indeed would be,

524
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:44,520
have a little bit different fingering, a little bit of a finger twister there.

525
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,090
Okay, last one I want to show you is

526
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,600
our descending arpeggio in A using open strings.

527
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,010
Okay, we'll go through real slowly,

528
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,030
cause it's kind of tricky.

529
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,450
Starts on the A, at the fifth fret,

530
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,780
G, then open E string.

531
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:16,680
Okay, try it again.

532
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:28,280
One more time, that's just the first half on.

533
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,060
Okay, okay, so the two parts of that [],

534
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,440
we have the first part, the second part,

535
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,880
I'll put both together now.

536
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,590
Okay, a little bit faster.

537
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,470
Great, now work on those sliding fourth and fifth exercise as well.

538
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,140
These are some of the colors that you can use in your electric guitar playing,

539
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,660
that make your playing stand out and be unique,

540
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,110
so I appreciate you taking the time to listen and to learn,

541
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,590
now you, now it's your turn to go and work on it

542
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,480
and become a guitar player that you need to be,

543
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,820
I'll catch you later.
