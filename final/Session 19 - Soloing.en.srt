00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,390
Hi, welcome to session 19,

2
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,680
in this session, we're going to talk about soloing,

3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,740
many different kinds of aspects of soloing.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,820
We talk about what makes up a good solo,

5
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,260
melody, rhythm, the harmonic structure of it, needs to have balance,

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,510
and most of all, you need to say something that's meaningful,

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,815
what doesn't make a good solo

8
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:58,740
and a lot of traps the guitar players falling into,

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,880
how to build up your own creativity,

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,670
how to start hearing guitar parts

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,740
and being able to put them out through your fingers,

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,540
we're gonna talk about soloing in various different playing styles

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,810
and get you a lot of good practice in doing those.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,435
In the how music works section,

15
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:15,430
we're going to learn about getting our fingers to play the melodies that we are hearing in our head

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,060
and choosing the right ideas, taking good melodies

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,890
and putting them in different playing situations,

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,740
so that we can make the most out of the little that we learn.

19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,600
Okay, so let's go ahead and get started.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,090
Okay, let's talk about soloing or improvising,

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,590
what does improvising mean,

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,210
that means just making up of the top of your head a melody,

23
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,940
that you can play along with the songs that you're going for,

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,490
okay, So you are making it up on the spot,

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,900
sometimes you can kind of have something pre made up,

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,600
but most all of this is improvising,

27
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,670
choosing the right notes to play,

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,980
there are many different ways that you can approach soloing.

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,040
Okay, first of all, you can get some key bits of information from the key,

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,260
what, what's the key signature telling you,

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,370
what key are we in,

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,630
doesn't matter what the first chord of the song is,

33
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,030
what's that key information,

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,850
that's what it may or may not go with the first chord of the song,

35
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,610
but that key information is telling you,

36
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,730
what major scale that you're able to solo around in

37
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,410
and get the sounds that you're going for.

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,660
Another way to look at is to use patterns,

39
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,970
like our pentatonic scale patterns, that we learned earlier.

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,800
Okay, we can use those somewhat,

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,220
it's a good thing to whip out,

42
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,190
but we don't want to just go straight down those patterns,

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,080
that doesn't make a very interesting solo,

44
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,170
we can also be guided by the chord tones

45
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,715
used in the progression that you're working on,

46
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:27,860
that's probably the key way,

47
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,680
the chord tones are vital to telling you

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,910
what notes are safe at any point in time

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,160
as you're going through these solo ideas,

50
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,995
or you can use all of these techniques simultaneously.

51
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:41,800
Well, let's first talk about what is making up a good solo,

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,380
how come some solos are good,

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,570
how come other ones just don't sound like they fit right,

54
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,340
there's a couple of key aspects to it,

55
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,810
first is melody,

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,460
You want catchy, noteworthy melody,

57
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,570
as you're as you're playing it, you want to create something that's memorable,

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,820
you want everything to fit together,

59
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,730
so, first thing is melody, second thing is balance,

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,250
you don't want to be playing something up high, something's up low,

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,110
something's fast, something slow

62
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,725
and just be jerking all around,

63
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,380
that creates, creates confusion in the listener

64
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,290
and doesn't end up being a very melonic solo.

65
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,210
Third thing is you need to say something,

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,280
one of my good friends is a guitarist by the name of David Moyes,

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,540
who used to be a guitarist for the group Air Supply back in the 80s,

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,650
and David was telling me a story

69
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,305
one time about he's up on stage down in Australia,

70
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:32,380
I believe, in Sydney, where Air Supply is from,

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,830
and they're playing

72
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,890
and I forget whether it was the manager of the band or the owner of the club or something,

73
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,180
he's back there playing a solo,

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,190
he's got his eyes closed,

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,220
and he opens his eyes and there's this guy standing right in front of him saying,

76
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,570
speak to me,

77
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,460
and he relates that story

78
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,760
about not just musically mumbling,

79
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,430
not just playing whatever pops into your head,

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,795
but by saying something when you play

81
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:58,150
and when you try and do a solo,

82
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,820
it's a little bit like a chef trying to make a good, a good meal,

83
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,270
you have to get all these aspects just right.

84
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,140
Now, we've talked about many different things,

85
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,120
we've talked about pentatonic patterns,

86
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,520
talked about major scales and keys,

87
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,240
but now we're gonna use all those tools

88
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,130
to try and see what makes up a good solo and a good melody.

89
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,890
Here's some things that guitar players fall into these traps all the time,

90
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,175
when trying to make a solo,

91
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:23,760
and they are, these are the things that don't make a good solo,

92
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,110
one is finger patterns,

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,605
it's great,

94
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,405
all these pentatonic patterns that we've learned

95
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:29,820
and we've got them underneath our fingers,

96
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,235
that's great for when we're, when we're rehearsing

97
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:34,230
and trying to learn these

98
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,680
and get those in our tool belt,

99
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,530
but when it's time to actually play a solo,

100
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,355
you don't want to be playing finger patterns,

101
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:42,000
it just doesn't work to be a very musical solo.

102
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,170
The second thing that guitar players think makes a good solo is speed,

103
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,740
and that's just a trap that we guitar players fall into,

104
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,620
you do not have to play screaming fast

105
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,960
in order to create a good, memorable solo,

106
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,345
that's just not how it's done,

107
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:59,410
if you listen to the solos on the songs that you're hearing on the radio,

108
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,680
chances are the guy's not just ripping through fast licks,

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,530
he's saying something with his melody.

110
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,580
The third is that, people fall into the trap of thinking it has to be complex,

111
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,375
if I want to make a really hip solo,

112
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,150
I have to make this big, complex things,

113
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,800
use all these color tones

114
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,540
and it'll end up being a good solo,

115
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,470
not necessarily, quite often times, it just ends up being a confusing mess,

116
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,610
because your note have the right amount of balance and melody in what's going on.

117
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,050
Okay, so a lot of what a lot of players say is help,

118
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,010
I don't know what to play,

119
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,875
well, here's where the tool bag of all these musical tools,

120
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,055
that we've been trying to cram into you, these last few sessions

121
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:39,010
are gonna come into play.

122
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,330
We're going to talk about creativity,

123
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,275
creativity is taking all the tools that we've learned so far and using them to make a solo,

124
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,720
not just putting them out there,

125
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,250
putting these pentatonic patterns out there and playing that,

126
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,375
that doesn't make a good solo,

127
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,040
we have to, we use them to actually create something that's that's memorable,

128
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,175
okay, just like a poem isn't made up by just choosing random words from the dictionary,

129
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:05,380
so a good solo isn't made up of just choosing random patterns and putting them together,

130
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,735
I heard someone say,

131
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:13,140
and I've always thought this in soloing there are no wrong notes, just poor choices,

132
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,520
and I think that is so true,

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
there are no wrong notes, just poor choices,

134
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,660
so let's learn a couple of key concepts

135
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,510
to choosing right notes when we solo.

136
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,330
Okay, the first is look at your key,

137
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,950
what key is this song in,

138
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,900
now, sometimes it can be a C, a C chord, can be in the key of C,

139
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,190
as well as in the key of F,

140
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,660
and also in the key of G,

141
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,380
so you can't necessarily look at the chords all the time,

142
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,260
you need to gather some information from all these different parts,

143
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,790
and a big one is the key,

144
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,080
what key are you looking at.

145
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,990
Okay, if the song has one flat in it,

146
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,380
chances are you could pretty much noodle around anywhere in F

147
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,115
and you'd be in the right key,

148
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:54,775
and look at the key gives us a good framework that we can start building our solo,

149
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,390
from what major scale can we use in order to start doing it.

150
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,100
Next, we want to look at the chords,

151
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,270
now here's a very big key of what to play when you're doing a solo,

152
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,540
look at these chords,

153
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,375
if the chords are like a C going to an Am,

154
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:12,000
well, what are the chord tones in each of these chords as they're going by,

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,650
as long as that C chord is going by,

156
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,440
you know that you can play a C E and a G

157
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,945
and you are standing on the safest pitches,

158
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:20,570
you can never stand on as a solo,

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,190
now, playing safe doesn't necessarily make a great solo,

160
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,330
but it's a good place to start

161
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,640
and you know what notes are safe,

162
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,370
if the next chord is let's say an Am7,

163
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,825
well, that has an A C E and a G,

164
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,280
well, what is common between a C chord and an Am7,

165
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,940
that C E and G,

166
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,420
so I can just play c through those entire two bars

167
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,880
and it'll work, and it'll, it'll sound correct,

168
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,680
so look at those chord tones,

169
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,800
all those chord [spelling] exercises that were so frustrating,

170
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,600
here's where they start coming into play

171
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,400
to be able to know the chord tones of the chords,

172
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
that you're trying to solo over the top of.

173
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,510
For example, let's take a look at example number one on these chord tone issues,

174
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,600
okay, we go from two bars of Cmaj7 to two bars of an Fmaj7,

175
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,670
okay, those two chords would be like this,

176
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,560
there's a Cmaj7, then an Fmaj7, would be like this,

177
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,385
now, the notes, what notes are in a Cmaj7,

178
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:19,290
well, it's a C E G and a B,

179
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,700
so I know, if I stay on just those four tones through those first two bars,

180
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,740
I'm not gonna clash with anything,

181
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,750
I might not make the most beautiful music in the world,

182
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,430
but I'm not at least not going to play a wrong note.

183
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,765
Okay, Fmaj7 what's the framework,

184
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:36,160
what are the pillars of of that, we need to be paying attention there,

185
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,040
F A C and an E,

186
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,830
so when it's time to change over to that F, what is change,

187
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,440
well, maybe the E is turned to an F,

188
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,630
maybe the G has turned to an A,

189
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,130
different things like that.

190
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,210
Those are ways little secrets that we can use to make a good solo in what we do.

191
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,520
Okay, now let's fire up the [band] here

192
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,395
and I'll try and play those chord tones as we're going through them,

193
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:58,290
so you can hear how the chord tones change,

194
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,390
okay, so this is number two in your book,

195
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,190
I'm just gonna play the chord tones,

196
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,440
great, okay, now those are just using the chord tones.

197
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,070
Okay, now we're gonna try and go a little bit more of a complex chord progression

198
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,285
and we're going to stretch those out a little bit longer

199
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:34,135
and give you an idea of what other things that we can do with that solo,

200
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:37,655
so we're gonna make each of those four measures double the length,

201
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:39,370
so you can have C for two bars now,

202
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,970
Am for two bars, Dm7 for two bars and G7 for two bars,

203
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,440
okay, so let's hear how that sounds.

204
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,015
Now, wasn't the most exciting melody in the world,

205
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:28,240
but I stayed real safe, I played those chord tones

206
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,380
and that's where it starts,

207
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,830
you don't just wake up one day

208
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,835
and suddenly magically able to play a great solo,

209
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:35,700
it starts by learning those chord tones.

210
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,640
Okay, now we're gonna, let's do it in a different style,

211
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,960
so I need to think what can I do differently that be more appropriate than that style,

212
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,295
now the next style we're gonna cover is kind of a rock thing,

213
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:46,980
so I'm gonna kick on my distortion here,

214
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,600
maybe a little bit of delay,

215
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,170
maybe crank it down here a little bit, get more of a distorted sound,

216
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,205
let's try that, same chords,

217
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,370
I'm just gonna change up the feel of it a little bit.

218
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,020
Okay.

219
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,440
Now, granted, that's not the, the, the most hippest example you'll hear on the radio,

220
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,660
but that's basically the concept,

221
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,320
I changed to a rock and roll style,

222
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,620
I need to get my guitar sounding the way I wanted it to sound,

223
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,600
I started using a lot of bends and things which are very characteristic in in rock playing.

224
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,710
Okay, let's do one more,

225
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,260
you want to be appropriate to the style that you're in

226
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,390
and not just play the same thing over and over again.

227
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,660
Let's do one more,

228
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,820
this one is kind of just a soft rock thing,

229
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,050
so I, maybe I'll warm up my sound a little bit,

230
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,600
put it on upper, pick up here,

231
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,950
through a little chords,

232
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,420
let's see what that sounds like.

233
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,035
Now, there I was pretty much sticking right close to those chord tones,

234
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,570
trying to make little melodies around them,

235
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,910
but I was sticking pretty close to those chord tones.

236
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,840
Okay, remember to say something,

237
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,750
not just to noodle around in a particular key,

238
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,130
you want to say something,

239
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,765
so let's talk about in our how music works section

240
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:11,800
about hearing melodies and being able to translate them through our fingers,

241
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,950
remember the items that we need to keep track of, when we soloing,

242
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,060
are we creating a good melody,

243
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,400
are we actually saying something,

244
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,760
are we in the right key,

245
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,640
are we using the right chord tones with that,

246
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,270
when you're playing your patterns,

247
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,030
don't just run through your patterns up and down,

248
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,040
try and make some music with it,

249
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,550
vary up the rhythm, vary up the notes that you're playing.

250
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,560
Okay, let's talk about creativity for a second,

251
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,180
hearing what you want to play,

252
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,100
I wish I could say there's a magic pill

253
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,470
to where I could give you the secret

254
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,580
and you could just automatically hear what notes you need to play and be able to play them,

255
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,805
the only way I found that,

256
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,510
you're able to hear a melody and then be able to play it back is

257
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,850
just by sheer trial and error,

258
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,770
you just do it a bunch of times,

259
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,730
and you get better at choosing the right notes,

260
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,260
remember that saying, good solo is made up of good choices,

261
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,390
there are no wrong notes, just poor choices,

262
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,665
that we learn about how to choose better notes,

263
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:06,780
when we do our solos.

264
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,670
Okay, it all starts with hearing,

265
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,220
okay, so we're gonna do a little bit of ear training exercise

266
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,975
for you to hear some different melodies,

267
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:14,820
I'm gonna play something

268
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,800
and then I want you to play it back to me.

269
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,250
I'm going to start just up here at the fifth fret,

270
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,140
so see if you can play what I'm playing,

271
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,350
one, two, ready go,

272
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,720
then your time, two, three, four,

273
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,630
again, now your time,

274
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,830
go, now your time,

275
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,155
ready again, one, two three,

276
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:48,090
let's start on a different note,

277
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,820
one two, ready and you play,

278
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,830
one, two, three, let's bend that note,

279
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,180
can you play it,

280
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,340
again, two, three, four.

281
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,280
Ear training is of utmost importance,

282
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,660
we're only able to buy time here

283
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,355
just to do a little bit of example of it,

284
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,140
but try and pick out melodies on the radio,

285
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,300
they have songs that you know,

286
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,680
try and pick them out in your guitar,

287
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,435
and yes, you'll make a bunch of mistakes at first,

288
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:23,335
you'll sound stupid,

289
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,155
a lot of folks, they get all bent out of shape of sounding stupid,

290
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:27,190
when they play a solo.,

291
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,890
well, you're gonna sound stupid for a while,

292
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,060
that's just how it is,

293
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,230
so you practice in your bedroom or whatever

294
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,005
and you don't get too bent out of shape with how you sound,

295
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:35,700
because you're learning,

296
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,850
you're learning how to walk,

297
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,210
just like a toddler is learning how to walk,

298
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,980
and that's what you're doing with soloing,

299
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,810
so don't get too bad out of shape that you make,

300
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,695
you're trying to go for one note

301
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,210
and you hit accidentally hit another one,

302
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,390
that's that was not the note that you were intending,

303
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,270
it's all part of learning and growing.

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,660
Okay, creativity is work, it's hard work,

305
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,020
and the good news is that the more you do it, the better you get at it,

306
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,575
if you're not hearing anything

307
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:00,660
and you don't know what to play,

308
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,430
well, start off with a finger pattern,

309
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,875
see if that does give you some ideas as you're going through it,

310
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,860
but basically it's just a lot of sheer repetition

311
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,680
and getting better at choosing the melodies that you want to do.

312
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,530
Here's your assignment for this week,

313
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,120
I want you to practice soloing over the Jam tracks exercises for the session 19,

314
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,140
look at the key, look at the chord tones and the style,

315
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,950
and try and derive a good recognizable melody from that,

316
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,580
remember, it's not about speed, complexity or doing finger patterns,

317
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,680
it's about creating something that says something.

318
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,440
Okay, I also want you to practice the ear training exercises with the Jam Along tracks

319
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,780
to help you train your ear,

320
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,690
a little bit goes a long way in training our ear,

321
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,610
the mechanics of playing the guitar are pretty straightforward,

322
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,360
it's the knowing what to play, that is the tricky part,

323
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,410
some start up high, some down low,

324
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,440
start different places on the neck, see what happens,

325
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,150
okay, we'll see you next time.

326
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,020
Okay, welcome to the workshop time,

327
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,250
let's see if we can put some of these soloing techniques that we've learned about into action,

328
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,945
so this one is gonna be a lot of listening tracks

329
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:07,070
and you try and play a melody,

330
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:07,990
I won't play too much,

331
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,840
I want you to try and pick out a melody as we go through these.

332
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,270
Okay, remember what makes a good solo,

333
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,265
melody, balance, say something when you play,

334
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:18,530
not just playing finger patterns,

335
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,560
speed and complexity don't make a good solo.

336
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,315
Okay, here we go,

337
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,130
let's try a few,

338
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,780
let's start with number two, or actually, no, let's start with number three

339
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,190
and you try and solo over these,

340
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,470
how'd you do on creating a solo,

341
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,055
did you get some ideas from that,

342
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,620
we're gonna do that one, one more time,

343
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,205
give you a little bit more opportunity

344
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:16,680
to get some chances of playing that,

345
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,880
okay, let's do it one more time.

346
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,180
Okay, now we're gonna take the same chord progression,

347
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,510
same exact chord progression, we're gonna put it in a different style,

348
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,915
this time is gonna be kind of a more of a rock style,

349
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,750
so try and use some bend of some notes,

350
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,710
okay, it kind of has an eighth note pulse

351
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,200
to see if you can maybe do something with that,

352
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,100
let's try it.

353
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,985
Greet, let's try it one more time,

354
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:51,460
give you another chance to go through it,

355
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,880
okay, here we go.

356
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,725
Okay, let's try one more,

357
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:31,480
this is a soft rock one,

358
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,520
okay, let's try this exercise.

359
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,495
Okay, now we're gonna do these exercises one more time,

360
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:17,635
this time, I'm not gonna play at all,

361
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:18,870
we're just gonna let the tracks run,

362
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,280
okay, starting on number three,

363
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,410
the Jazz one, that starts in C and Am.

364
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,180
Great, okay, let's take a look at the next one, number four.

365
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,840
Great, how'd you do,

366
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,305
let's take a look at that next one,

367
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:52,405
this one changes to a little bit of a soft rock style,

368
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,280
so be ready for that.

369
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,275
Now there are plenty more exercises in your Jam Along CDs

370
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,670
to give you practice and so on,

371
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,370
I would encourage you to go through all of them,

372
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,140
different styles, different keys,

373
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,910
give you all the practice that you need.

374
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,870
Let me give you some encouragement,

375
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,690
good, soloing takes time and lots of trial and error,

376
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,260
you didn't learn to walk overnight,

377
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,290
and you're not going to learn how to play a solo overnight either,

378
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,530
takes a lot of just doing it over and over and over again

379
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,820
till you find out what works,

380
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,690
it's like begin, it's like you're putting words together to start forming sentences,

381
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,550
that's how soloing is,

382
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,380
so don't be discouraged with yourself,

383
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,240
you're gonna sound bad for a while,

384
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,380
that's kind of how soloing is,

385
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,490
if you let that discourage you,

386
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,560
then you'll never venture out

387
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,090
and start doing what you need to do,

388
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,710
so I'll go ahead and see you next time.
