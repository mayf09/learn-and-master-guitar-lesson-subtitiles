00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,550
Hi, and welcome to session four of learn and master guitar,

2
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,870
this time we're going to talk about the fifth and the sixth string,

3
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,820
we've already covered the first, second, third and fourth,

4
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,410
now we're up to the fifth and sixth,

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,030
going to look at them notes on those strings,

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,140
once we conquer those,

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,450
we have conquered all the notes in the first position,

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,990
that's what today is all about wrapping up all of our notes,

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,660
we've learned two-thirds of them so far,

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,460
we've got one-third more of the notes to come,

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,900
then we're going to put it all together,

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,030
we also need to talk to you about sharps and flats,

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,650
playing in different keys

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,360
and we're going to learn two more chords,

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,100
we are going to learn Am and E,

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,570
so I hope you're ready to get started,

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,010
let's go ahead and have some fun.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,770
Now we're going to talk about the notes on the fifth string,

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,690
here's three more notes on the fifth string,

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,930
starts out with an open A,

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,770
fifth string open is A,

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,730
play one more time, A.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,330
Now you'll notice we're at two ledger lines deep underneath that staff,

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,810
guitar reads pretty low on the staff,

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,030
we'll get as low as three ledger lines

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,190
and when we talk about the notes on the sixth string,

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,470
but A that's two ledger lines down,

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,880
take a good look at it,

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,610
sometimes it might get confusing when we start adding those ledger lines,

30
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,470
but the more you do it, the better you'll get at it.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,090
The second note on the fifth string is a B,

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,360
with our second finger on the second fret,

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,320
here's a B

34
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,300
okay, now you try and play with me, ready.

35
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,230
Now the third note on that fifth string is a C,

36
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,770
we've learned A, we've learned B

37
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,110
and now we're gonna learn C, third finger, third fret, C,

38
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,800
ready, let's play together, C.

39
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:22,130
Let's go through all the notes A, B and C.

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,130
Alright, take a look at your fifth string exercises,

41
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,540
we're going to number one on that,

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,850
we just work this out on those lower notes,

43
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,930
now, as we're getting to these lower notes,

44
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,600
make sure that your wrist is underneath the guitar,

45
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,400
if your wrist is way up here,

46
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,500
then you're going to start running out of fingers,

47
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,260
when we start when we start trying to play notes way down here on the neck,

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,760
you got to lower that risk,

49
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,710
I know what you want to put this up,

50
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,540
that helps you with your hand strength,

51
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,880
but you need to get these fingers stronger,

52
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,920
so they need to do what they need to do

53
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,100
and part of that is lowering that risk down a little bit,

54
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,510
so keep that wrist nice and low,

55
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,430
make sure you've got some air space right in here.

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,030
Okay, as we go down for these low notes,

57
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,410
here we go, exercise number one,

58
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,750
lets play together, starts on that low A,

59
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,240
ready, go,

60
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,810
A, second finger B,

61
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,180
now C, two three four,

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,830
C B A, good,

63
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,010
A C A.

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,630
Very good, try one more time it's a little bit faster,

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,800
ready, play,

66
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,940
A B C, two three four,

67
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,390
C B A, there you go, A B A.

68
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,500
Good, alright, look at exercise number two,

69
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,700
we'll slow it back down a little bit,

70
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,140
added some eighth notes into it,

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,640
let's see if we can do this one.

72
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,150
Ready, exercise number two,

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,040
ready, play, A A A,

74
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:35,440
let's do it again, do it again, A.

75
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,310
Very good, okay, now let's learn the notes on the sixth string,

76
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,240
this is the last [] of notes that you need to learn here for a few minutes.

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,010
On the sixth string, we have open E,

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,830
three ledger lines down, that's as low as you go,

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,600
you don't get any lower than that on the guitar,

80
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
three ledger lines down, that an E,

81
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,040
then first finger, F,

82
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,320
and third finger, G,

83
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,290
now wait a minute, we got E F and G,

84
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,670
just like on the first string,

85
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,120
we have open E F and G,

86
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,900
the six string is an E as well,

87
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,800
as we go E F G.

88
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,150
Okay, now that six string is a good bit thicker than all the rest of the strings,

89
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,040
so you're really gonna have to push those fingers down,

90
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,370
give them a good workout doing these six string exercises,

91
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,140
it may be a little buzzy at first,

92
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,980
may come out sound a little bit like that,

93
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,350
just work on that hand pressure a little bit,

94
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,970
make sure you're doing all the right things,

95
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,650
hugging up right behind that fret

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,840
and you'll get those notes to sound out clearly,

97
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,890
even if it's buzzing out,

98
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,880
you keep working at it

99
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,920
and they'll get steadier and stronger.

100
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,700
Let's do those six string exercise,

101
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,640
we're going to start on that page exercise number three,

102
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,710
ready, we'll go nice and slow,

103
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,990
ready, play,

104
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,730
E F G,

105
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,150
G F E,

106
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,990
now some eighth notes, down up,

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,490
pretty good, let's try one more time,

108
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,060
ready, go.

109
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,120
Alright, now let's put all of the notes together,

110
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,680
everything that we've learned so far

111
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,630
and do exercise number four,

112
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,190
look at all those eighth notes,

113
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,750
we're going to take it pretty slow,

114
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,170
okay, we're just gonna go through all these notes one by one.

115
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,700
Ready, starts down on low E,

116
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,520
ready, play,

117
00:06:49,070 --> 00:07:11,870
E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G, G, G

118
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,390
and now we're gonna head back down, you ready,

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:33,390
G F E D C B A G F E D C B A G F E.

120
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,610
Very good, those are the notes we've learned on the fifth and sixth string,

121
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,200
fifth string A B and C,

122
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,960
six string E F and G.

123
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,290
Let's review all of our first position notes,

124
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,300
when I mean, when I say first position,

125
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,290
I mean down here on this end of the guitar,

126
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,430
position, when I say position, that refers to your fret that you're on,

127
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,320
sometimes you'll be in the fifth position,

128
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,670
that means you start your hand on the fifth position, on the fifth fret,

129
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,880
its third position, you'd start your hand and you do your fingers,

130
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,480
remember, first finger, second finger, third finger, pinky, covers both,

131
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,850
that would be like a position that would be in third,

132
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,830
but we're going to be down in first position

133
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,360
and that's where we've learned all of our notes.

134
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,400
Okay, so let's review one more time,

135
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,830
on the sixth string, we've got E F and G,

136
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,490
E F G,

137
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,530
on the fifth string A B and C,

138
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,650
A B C,

139
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,490
the fourth string, we've got D E F,

140
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,240
the third string, we've got G and A,

141
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,590
second string, we've got B C and D,

142
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,860
E F and G.

143
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,350
Okay, now we're gonna go down backwards,

144
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,060
try not to look at the music,

145
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,130
want you to just look at your hands,

146
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,810
or just think about what these notes are,

147
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,740
as we play them down,

148
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,070
give them insight internalize these notes

149
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,720
rather than just reading them off the page,

150
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
I want you to understand where they're at,

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,880
try not to look at the music,

152
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,230
let's just go down backwards,

153
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,850
say the notes, while you're playing them.

154
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,750
Ready,

155
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:31,440
G F E D C B A G F E D C B A G F E,

156
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,520
very good.

157
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
Okay, now, let's go,

158
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,870
if you look at your first position note exercise,

159
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,860
we're going do number one,

160
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,770
we're going to climb up basically a C scale

161
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,390
and we haven't learned about scales yet,

162
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,530
but it is a C scale

163
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,150
and it starts on fifth string, third fret, that's C.

164
00:09:49,730 --> 00:10:00,030
Ready, play,

165
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:17,390
and it goes back down,

166
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,860
very good, let's play a little bit faster now,

167
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:33,910
ready.

168
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,630
There you go,

169
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,540
now we're gonna do one more exercise,

170
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,000
that incorporates all the notes that we've learned so far,

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,920
Minuet in C,

172
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,470
take a look at that in your books, open that up,

173
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,210
let's go through that slowly one time.

174
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,330
Here we go,

175
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,470
ready, play,

176
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,400
one two,

177
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,190
two three,

178
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,240
very good.

179
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,350
Okay, now we need to talk about one more concept,

180
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,610
sharps and flats,

181
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,870
now I'm sure you've been wondering,

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,580
we've got, on this first string, we've got open, first and third,

183
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,320
but what about what's this note in between,

184
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,760
what's that note,

185
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,840
well, just like there are black keys and white keys on a piano,

186
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,510
each of them being a half-step apart,

187
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:10,070
a guitar every fret that you see on the neck is exactly one half-step

188
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,570
and different notes

189
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,930
either have a half-step in between them

190
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,240
or don't have a half-step in between them,

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,280
half and whole steps is, what this is called,

192
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,280
when you have two half-steps put together makes up a whole step,

193
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,400
but each of these is one half-step apart,

194
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,950
so let's now we're going to talk about the notes that are in between the notes.

195
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,970
There's two ways to look at them,

196
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,100
let's talk about sharps first,

197
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,700
the little number sign looking symbol is a sharp sign,

198
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,750
what that means is,

199
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,160
it takes whatever note that you is in front of it,

200
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,840
you see the sharp sign,

201
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,240
you raise that note up one half step, one fret worth on your guitar,

202
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,980
and that's what sharps do,

203
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,510
you've learned all the notes so far,

204
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,660
now we're just going to adjust those notes a little bit using sharps and flats,

205
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,400
let's look at the sharp line first,

206
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,710
we're going to start on this F, first finger f,

207
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,700
now remember finger rule supply,

208
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,150
so when I go to this F#, which would be right here,

209
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,230
my second finger would cover that,

210
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,070
first finger covers everything in the first fret on all strings,

211
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,080
second covers anything on the second,

212
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,060
third covers anything on the third,

213
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,450
pinky pulls double duty,

214
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,720
anything that happens on the fourth or the fifth, pinky covers.

215
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,290
So we have F and now we've got F#,

216
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,550
okay, and we've got G and then we've got G#,

217
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,900
on this next string,

218
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,460
we would have a C,

219
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,500
then a C# with our second finger,

220
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,620
D, then a D# with our pinky,

221
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,780
good.

222
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,200
On the third string, we would have open G,

223
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,210
now how do I sharpen open string,

224
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,900
well, you put your first finger on that string,

225
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,150
and that would be a G#, there,

226
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,260
okay, so we have G, we've got G#,

227
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,910
second finger would be A,

228
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,910
after that would be an A#,

229
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,570
okay, on the fourth string,

230
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,010
we have D,

231
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,630
how did we sharpen open string,

232
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,410
put our first finger on that first fret, D#,

233
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,770
and E, oh, here's our first problem,

234
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,870
if I wanted an E#,

235
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,670
that would be on the third fret,

236
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,530
but that's already an F, you're probably saying to yourself,

237
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,490
you're exactly right,

238
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,660
and E# is an F,

239
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,250
F is the more common name,

240
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,620
so you hardly ever hear it referred to as an E#,

241
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,660
but I guess technically it would be an E#,

242
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,480
there is F, where an F#,

243
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,310
we got our pinky over here.

244
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,320
The fifth string got open A,

245
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,320
if I wanted A#, it will be there,

246
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,150
B, then B# or more commonly known to a C,

247
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,920
then C#.

248
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,360
On the last string,

249
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,070
let's just start on the F,

250
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,430
second finger F#,

251
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,820
third finger G, G#,

252
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,430
see how those work sharps,

253
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,080
sharps go up a half-step.

254
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,820
Now let's talk about the opposite way,

255
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,740
I can take a note up a half-step,

256
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,920
but I can also take a note and bring it down a half-step

257
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,480
and those are called flats,

258
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,030
when it is a flat, that's that little b,

259
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,220
it looks like a [] b,

260
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,210
that's a flat sign,

261
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,590
when you see that by a note,

262
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,770
you play the note a half step down

263
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,950
from where we had done initially,

264
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,000
if it were just plain,

265
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,160
okay, so let's do a few of these.

266
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,310
Starts out on a G,

267
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,200
now if I want a Gb,

268
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,330
I would not go up this way,

269
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,650
I wouldn't go this way on the neck,

270
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,270
I would go back down this way,

271
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,030
what should be a Gb,

272
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,380
got it, G, Gb,

273
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,190
now wait a minute, where was that F# that we learned a little bit ago,

274
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,350
F, F#,

275
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,750
F# and Gb are the same note,

276
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,000
you're just looking at it from different perspectives,

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,350
if I'm on F,

278
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,630
I would look up there would be an F#,

279
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,680
if I met a G,

280
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm looking down on it, flat it, it would be a Gb,

281
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,130
so when you get into these sharps and flats notes,

282
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,130
a lot of times, they'll have you come out from either direction,

283
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,690
so you have two names for the same note.

284
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,460
So we have G, we have Gb,

285
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,170
then we have f,

286
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,860
go down the next open,

287
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,450
and here's our first problem,

288
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,870
how do I flat an open string,

289
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,580
I can't get any lower than open string,

290
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,090
the rule says you go down to the next string,

291
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,030
which would be the second string and use your pinky,

292
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,290
so, so that would be an Eb,

293
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,510
the rule is you go down to the next string and use your pinky,

294
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,570
so here's a E, here's an Eb,

295
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,830
let's keep going, D, Db,

296
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,430
C, then B.

297
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,830
Okay, here's the one exception to the rule here I just taught you rule

298
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,690
and this is going to be the one exception to the rule.

299
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,390
On the third string,

300
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,520
just has to do with how the guitar is tuned

301
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,620
and how it's been tuned [over the ages],

302
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,420
a Bb, which is what we're going for

303
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,470
would not be with your pinky,

304
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,700
which is what the rule would say,

305
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,530
this is the one exception,

306
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,870
a Bb is with your third finger,

307
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,140
B, Bb,

308
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,460
A, Ab, G,

309
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,780
now we're back to our rule again,

310
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,100
how do we flatten open string,

311
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,330
fourth, we go the fourth finger, the next string down Gb,

312
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:53,050
F, E, Eb, D,

313
00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:02,250
let's keep going, Db C B Bb A,

314
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:09,590
Ab, G, we're giving our pinky a good workout, Gb and F.

315
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,550
Very good, and that's sharps and flats.

316
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,330
Okay, one more concept,

317
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,040
I need to tell you about in sharps and flats,

318
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,240
sharps and flats have a time duration on them,

319
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,020
time duration what that means is

320
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,640
they are good for one measure,

321
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,230
so if you look in your example there,

322
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,310
an F going to an F#,

323
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,660
once I sharp that F,

324
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,900
then that F is sharp for the rest of the measure,

325
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,370
no matter whether it's high F, low F, or media F,

326
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,210
you know whatever F, as soon as one F sharp, all Fs are sharp

327
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,890
for the complete rest of the measure,

328
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,630
once I hit that bar line,

329
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,100
then it resets again,

330
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,390
now, what if I get to that second F#

331
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,070
and I really don't want it to be an F#,

332
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,300
how can I cancel it out,

333
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,460
that's where you use a natural sign,

334
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,500
a natural sign looks like kind of two Ls backed up against each other,

335
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,010
that cancels out a previously held sharp or flat.

336
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,960
We're going to learn two chords today,

337
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,360
we're going to learn Am and an E.

338
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,830
The m standing next to the standing next to A, that's the minor,

339
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,840
it's a symbol for minors, Am.

340
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,090
Let's go through it,

341
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,290
let's take a look at Am,

342
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,550
there's nothing happening on the sixth string,

343
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,200
the fifth string is open,

344
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,810
on the fourth string, you have your second finger,

345
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,690
third string, you have your third finger down there on the second fret,

346
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,730
first finger on that C

347
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,380
and the last string is open.

348
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,450
I played them in each note individually would sound like this,

349
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,850
one more time,

350
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,880
altogether,

351
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,920
that's Am chord.

352
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,170
Now an E chord has exactly the same finger shape,

353
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,980
if you just move everybody up a whole string set,

354
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,200
just move everybody up the whole string set

355
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,220
and you end up with an E chord,

356
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,040
that a six string chord, use all six strings,

357
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,440
that it individually.

358
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,510
Now let's go through your two exercises, your three exercises there,

359
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,660
exercise one goes from between the Am and the E,

360
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,530
it just practices jumping you between those two chords.

361
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Here we go, Am,

362
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,880
ready play, two three,

363
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,090
now an E, two, three,

364
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,440
back to the Am,

365
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,350
back to E,

366
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,100
and it ends up on that Am.

367
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,730
Okay, exercise number two,

368
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,570
starts with a C,

369
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,910
we're going to combine some of our other chords, that we've already had,

370
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,480
remember we had the C, the G7,

371
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,280
and now we are adding the Am and E.

372
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,860
Let's do exercise number two,

373
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:20,400
one two, ready, go,

374
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,050
Am,

375
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:30,180
here comes E

376
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,040
G7

377
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,130
C.

378
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,870
Okay, on exercise three,

379
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,340
I throw them in there together,

380
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,480
they're all mixed up together,

381
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,250
but they change a little bit faster,

382
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,840
I'll take this one pretty slow for you.

383
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,030
Exercise number three,

384
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,180
ready, C chord,

385
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,750
now Am chord,

386
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:04,460
G7, for four beats, two three four,

387
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,530
open E one two,

388
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,490
Am

389
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,070
and a C chord.

390
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,940
Very good.

391
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,600
Now let's talk about your assignment for this session,

392
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,500
session four,

393
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,390
what I want you to do is

394
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,550
all of the notes in the first position.

395
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,770
Go through, sing and play all the way from low E up to high G,

396
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,060
sing and play,

397
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,170
trying to do with the music,

398
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,330
try to do without the music and just memorize them.

399
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,640
There's also some notes in the first position exercises there,

400
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,690
that I'd like for you to cover,

401
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,970
we're also going to cover three songs,

402
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,560
are biggest songs yet,

403
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:50,580
Simple Gifts, Minuet in G, and The Star Spangled Banner.

404
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,430
So work on those and we can work on them together in the workshop time.

405
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,620
Now let me talk about some guitar tips,

406
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,850
in the guitar tips section today,

407
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,100
I wanted to just cover, I didn't want to cover any material,

408
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,600
but I just want to encourage you,

409
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,210
if you're serious about guitar playing,

410
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,300
what you need to do is work hard at it,

411
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,760
I can present it to you in a fairly short amount of time,

412
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,270
but you will only get better with the effort that you put into it,

413
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,070
and a little bit of effort,

414
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,030
it's the guys that put slow consistent effort into it

415
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,120
are the ones that actually end up playing guitar at the end of the day,

416
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,240
it's not the guys that always dream about guitar playing

417
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,210
or hang around guitar players or anything like that,

418
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,130
those aren't the ones that actually get the job done,

419
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,360
I've been teaching for years

420
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,580
and I've been playing for years and years and years

421
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,500
and I have not found another way to get better

422
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:52,700
other than good old hard work sitting on your couch, sitting on your bed, doing simple exercises,

423
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,070
you may feel like why am I doing these dopey little tunes,

424
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,960
what I really want to be playing great stuff,

425
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,340
I have not found another shortcut to be able to do it

426
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,420
other than working hard,

427
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,680
so I just encourage you,

428
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,300
if you've made it this far in this series,

429
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,250
you're obviously serious about what you're doing

430
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,870
and I would encourage you to keep it up,

431
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,550
we've finished through the single notes

432
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,200
and we're getting ready to start into chords,

433
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,250
which is kind of another hemisphere of guitar playing

434
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,260
and you're getting ready to come into some fun stuff,

435
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,990
but your hard work here and diligence will pay off.

436
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,520
Hey, welcome session four guitar workshop,

437
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,930
here's where we get the job done,

438
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,630
here's where we really get the skills that we need to get done,

439
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,250
you're ready, let's practice,

440
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,660
first thing we need to do is

441
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,270
review all of our notes that we've gone through so far,

442
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,400
so we're starting on that low E,

443
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,880
let's go through them and let's play and sing together,

444
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,420
you ready?

445
00:24:40,030 --> 00:25:03,250
E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G,

446
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,690
go down backwards,

447
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:22,720
G, D C B A G F E D C.

448
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,070
Let's go through those one more time,

449
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,270
a little bit faster,

450
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:41,770
ready play,

451
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,830
back down,

452
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,570
make sure your fingers are moving just like a machine,

453
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,300
just coming on and off just like you want them to,

454
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,210
when they're not playing something,

455
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,250
they should be hovering right above the fret board.

456
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,550
Okay, now let's go through all of your notes one more time,

457
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,080
this time we're gonna go pretty fast,

458
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,040
see if you can keep up.

459
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:13,150
Ready play,

460
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:28,600
one more time.

461
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,920
Okay, now let's do a couple of exercises,

462
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,130
if you look at your fifth and sixth string exercise sheet,

463
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,430
we're going to look at number four on that sheet,

464
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,070
so let's do that,

465
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,390
number four on the fifth string, fifth and sixth string exercise sheet,

466
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,770
you ready, let's play,

467
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:13,770
ready, go,

468
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,210
G G G,

469
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:26,340
now you go back down.

470
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,280
There you go, now, we also learned two chords,

471
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,680
we learned an Am and an E,

472
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,390
let's review those,

473
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,830
here's an Am,

474
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,360
here's an E,

475
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,300
let's play four Ams and four Es,

476
00:27:53,780 --> 00:28:01,030
go,

477
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,260
one more time,

478
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,460
four Ams,

479
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,480
E,

480
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,390
Am, two three four.

481
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,840
Very good, we also learned about sharps and flats,

482
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,380
remember sharps, sharps take, not sharks, but sharps,

483
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,580
sharps take whatever note you're playing and you raise it up a half step,

484
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,010
one fret worth on the guitar.

485
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,060
Remember our exercise that we did,

486
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,470
let's go through a couple of those,

487
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,390
on the first string F,

488
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,210
then F# would be with our second finger,

489
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,070
G, G#.

490
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,470
On the second string,

491
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:53,010
C C#, D and D#.

492
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,950
And we have open G,

493
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,150
how do we sharpen open string,

494
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,910
with our first finger G#,

495
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,980
A, A#.

496
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:12,820
Next string D, D#, E, E# or F, then F#.

497
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:22,240
Open A, A# B C C#.

498
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:32,050
Open E, F F# G and G#.

499
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,910
Now, remember flats go the opposite way,

500
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,350
instead of going up a half step,

501
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,910
which would be this way on the neck,

502
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,920
they go down a half step,

503
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,360
which would be going the opposite way.

504
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,350
So if we started on this G,

505
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:48,800
it'd be G Gb F E,

506
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,910
remember our rule,

507
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,230
how do we flatten open string,

508
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,540
go to the next string down, use a pinky,

509
00:29:54,010 --> 00:30:01,150
Eb D Db C B,

510
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,440
here's the one that's different,

511
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,930
third finger on the Bb,

512
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,220
A Ab G,

513
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:18,170
Gb F E Eb D,

514
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:27,690
Db C B Bb A,

515
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,300
Ab G Gb and F.

516
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,470
Okay, now we need to cover a couple of songs,

517
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,560
the songs that I asked you to play were

518
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:45,750
The Star Spangled Banner Banner, Minuet and Simple Gifts,

519
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,670
we're going to start with The Star Spangled Banner,

520
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,110
so go ahead and get that out.

521
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,910
Let's take a look at this.

522
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,730
We're in three four time,

523
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,030
now you'll notice the first two notes are just two eighth notes

524
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,380
and it's not even a full measure,

525
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,150
those are called pickup notes,

526
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,060
they occur actually before the first full measure of music,

527
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,920
it's quite a common thing in music,

528
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,400
you just play those and don't worry about them,

529
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,430
just play as if they were coming right into that first beat,

530
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,530
you ready, here we go.

531
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:21,000
One, play,

532
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,410
F# with your pinky,

533
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:38,300
here you go,

534
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,830
two,

535
00:31:49,920 --> 00:32:05,960
one two, here comes F# again,

536
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,270
one two,

537
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,040
one two,

538
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:46,220
one two,

539
00:32:46,430 --> 00:33:09,610
F# G two.

540
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,420
Now you'll notice,

541
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,890
in the last measure,

542
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,030
you have a half note,

543
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,070
where's it should have three beats in it,

544
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,480
where's the other beat,

545
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,510
that makes up for where those pickups came in,

546
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,340
if there's a partial measure at the beginning,

547
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,200
there's going to be a partial measure at the end,

548
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,190
truncate it,

549
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,470
so that they both match up to make a full measure,

550
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,430
why they do that,

551
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,360
I don't know why they do that,

552
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,560
that's kind of how it is.

553
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,870
Let's play The Star Spangled Banner one more time,

554
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,060
this time a little bit faster up to tempo,

555
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,450
now you'll notice the rhythm is slightly different from how we sing it,

556
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,020
that's because we haven't quite got to some of the more complex rhythms yet

557
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,270
of which Star Spangled Banner has in it

558
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,010
and are more common vocal version of it,

559
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
so just bear with us,

560
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,260
if you want to throw this in,

561
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,460
you're more than welcome to,

562
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,990
we're going to pick it up a little bit

563
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,830
and do it one more time.

564
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:49,280
Ready, go,

565
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:07,790
little bit of a pause there,.

566
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,730
See how I just did the rhythm a little bit to be more like our vocal version of it.

567
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,220
Okay, now let's take a look at Simple Gifts,

568
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,210
now you'll notice,

569
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,600
in this one there's a sharp sign way up at the very beginning,

570
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,010
it's not even by a note or anything,

571
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,930
that's called a key signature,

572
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,250
we'll talk more about those later,

573
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,180
but all this means,

574
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,340
kind of a global setting on your computer,

575
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,780
once that there's a sharp sign over that F,

576
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,660
that means that every f in the entire song,

577
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,060
whether high medium or low is going to be sharp,

578
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,880
and it doesn't even have to have a sharp sign by it,

579
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,330
once that sharp sign is up in the key signature right up at the front of the song,

580
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,100
that means every F you see is going to be an F#,

581
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,060
okay, whether it's high medium or low, okay.

582
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,390
So here we go,

583
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,740
let's do Simple Gifts,

584
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,390
got a pickup note again,

585
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:02,030
here we go, ready, play,

586
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:13,150
here comes an F#,

587
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,920
keep going, one two,

588
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,690
Very good, very traditional song.

589
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,060
Now we're going to play through it one more time,

590
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,800
but I particularly want to work with you,

591
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,430
on that one measure, what is that the fourth measure of that song,

592
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,140
it has an F# in it.

593
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,950
Okay, let's just do that measure

594
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,210
and work on it slowly,

595
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,170
we'll do it a couple times,

596
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,430
then we'll play the whole song again,

597
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,710
so in that measure four,

598
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,760
it goes starts on A,

599
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:36,140
do one more time,

600
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,100
a little bit faster.

601
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,730
Very good, okay, just play Simple Gifts one more time,

602
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,260
I'll do it a little bit faster now,

603
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,550
so you can keep up.

604
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,220
Ready, go.

605
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,510
There you go, that's Simple Gifts,

606
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,850
now the next one we need to cover is Minuet.

607
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,400
Okay, let's take a look at Minuet in G,

608
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,070
that G is referring to keys,

609
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,930
which we'll learn a little bit more about later,

610
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,660
but look it also has that F# up in the corner,

611
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,830
so what does that mean,

612
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,920
all the Fs are going to be sharp.

613
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,300
Okay, so let's go ahead and try and play it nice and slow,

614
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,770
you'll probably recognize the melody.

615
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,040
Ready, play,

616
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:10,450
here comes F#, there you go,

617
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,970
here's another F#,

618
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,160
F#,

619
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,340
one last F#, two three, next page,

620
00:39:52,430 --> 00:40:07,550
here comes a C# with our second finger,

621
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,810
dotted half note, two three,

622
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,140
this is a little tricky here,

623
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:41,390
two three.

624
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,640
Okay, that's going through it, kind of slow,

625
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,280
let's see if we can play it a little bit faster now.

626
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,440
You ready,

627
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,210
remember those F#,

628
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,920
there's also that C# in there.

629
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:12,620
Here we go, ready, play,

630
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:39,620
two three.

631
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,090
Very, very good,

632
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,850
okay remember, remember your practice schedule,

633
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,150
if you can be putting in fifteen to twenty minutes five out of seven days a week,

634
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,580
that is about the time span you need to make good progress with all this,

635
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,430
guitar playing can be a rich and rewarding skill

636
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,380
and effort will help you improve,

637
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,790
so keep working hard at it

638
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,840
and I'll see you next time.
