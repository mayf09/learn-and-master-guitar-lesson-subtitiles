00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,800
Hi, welcome to session 17,

2
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,865
in this session, we're going to learn about

3
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:38,510
playing in any key, any place on the neck,

4
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,340
learning the entire fretboard,

5
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,130
and we're going to learn the wonder of three note on a string scales,

6
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,965
what they are

7
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:49,540
and how many great sounds you can pull out of these scales,

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,630
we're also going to learn about triplets, a new rhythmic concept,

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,090
and we're going to talk about hammer-ons and pull-offs

10
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,180
as they relate to three note on a string scales,

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,100
in the how music works section,

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,260
we're going to cover what seventh chords are,

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,560
how to build them and how to use them.

14
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:05,940
So, let's go ahead and get started.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,005
Okay, there's such a wonderful advantage to learning the entire neck of the instrument,

16
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,705
most guitar players learn the first position

17
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:17,280
and they never even bother to get up into the upper [registers] of the instrument

18
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,720
and they just don't know what what notes these are,

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,450
what note is this, What note is that,

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,470
they just kind of get lost as you get going up.

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,480
Now, we've talked about what the notes are on the sixth string and the fifth string,

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,710
okay, there was one simple exercise that has helped me learn the entire neck of the guitar,

23
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,020
it's real easy for me to explain

24
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,170
and it took me probably three months

25
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,835
to actually get it in my tool belt of things

26
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,100
I can do as a guitar player,

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,310
and I tell you I use it every time I try and play a solo,

28
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,830
and every time I'm in a studio session or any type of solo situation,

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,680
I use a simple concept, called three note on a string scales.

30
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,660
The name is pretty self explanatory,

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,520
basically, here's the whole idea,

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,170
you take a major scale,

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,830
but I want you to play three notes on every string of that major scale,

34
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,440
so as you going up the major scale,

35
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,860
every three notes you're gonna be on a new string.

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,060
Okay, so you'll find that as we play this,

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,740
it involves your hand to stretch quite a bit more

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,830
than we've normally stretched up until this point,

39
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,340
and it gets you working slowly up the neck of the guitar.

40
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,485
Now, what has helped me as I'm doing this scale is

41
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,150
to say and play the notes,

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,190
what's the goal of this,

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,840
not just to learn another pattern,

44
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,450
but to be able to learn the neck of your guitar.

45
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,770
So let's, we're going to start it off,

46
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,595
we're going to start off in the key of F,

47
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,190
since that's the lowest one down here,

48
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,950
what is the key of F having it, a Bb,

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,440
remember that, F G A Bb C D E F is the F major scale

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,470
and we're going to do it three notes per string.

51
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,630
So here we go,

52
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,610
we have F, then G, then A,

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,990
now I can go to the next string, Bb C D,

54
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,605
notice how wide I have to have my hand in order to cover that,

55
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:17,190
that's going to be real important how wide you can stretch your hand,

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,650
next string, I go E F G,

57
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,210
next string I have A Bb, don't forget the Bb C,

58
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,760
then I shift up, I'm slowly shifting up positions,

59
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,500
D E F,

60
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,510
G A Bb.

61
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,210
Okay, so in the course of that,

62
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,970
I have shifted my hand three times,

63
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,265
but I was able to grab another five or six notes

64
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:56,460
out of the major scale coming down here,

65
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,290
because I did three notes on a string.

66
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,670
Let's do that one more time,

67
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,510
starts on an F,

68
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:28,050
F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb.

69
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,820
Okay, let's do it one more time,

70
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,800
this time I want you to say them with me,

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,720
as you're playing them,

72
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,460
okay, remember to stretch out that hand,

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,640
as far as your left hand and stretching goes,

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,500
okay, we did a little stretching exercise at the very beginning,

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,100
that's a good exercise to get your fingers limbered up,

76
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,280
but remember, your hands will stretch over time,

77
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,620
as you try and do larger and larger forms,

78
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,520
in the beginning, wow, just to get a barre chord, six string barre chord form,

79
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,490
we really felt like we had to stretch so much,

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,390
now we're getting into more complex form,

81
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,270
so we really got to open that hand up.

82
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,570
Okay, here we go,

83
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,120
let's say play them together,

84
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,400
ready go,

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:31,420
F, F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb.

86
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,630
Okay, now that is one form of the three note on a string scale,

87
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,250
now, how many notes are there in a major scale,

88
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,590
seven, and then we hit the octave, right,

89
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,415
so there's seven, there's going to be seven different forms patterns of these three note on string scales

90
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:51,410
as we go up our neck.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,970
Okay, so are we just done the first one,

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,100
okay, now let's do the second one.

93
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,465
So now I'm going to do the F scale,

94
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:00,295
but I'm going to start on a G,

95
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:02,940
so I'm starting on the second step of the F scale,

96
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,795
so I shift my hand up here,

97
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:09,030
first finger is on that third fret G,

98
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,090
still same concept, three notes per string,

99
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,310
and I end up with a little bit different finger pattern.

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,690
Let's do this one,

101
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,710
G A Bb,

102
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,790
C D, big stretch out here to E,

103
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,500
F G A,

104
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,970
Bb C D,

105
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,170
now I got to stretch

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,770
and shift positions up to fifth position to catch this E,

107
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,100
I always want the first note of a three to be with my first finger,

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,090
E F G A Bb C,

109
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,830
now you'll notice everything is up one step,

110
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,530
not -} only did I start one step up,

111
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,600
but I ended one step up from the other one.

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,990
Let's do that second form one more time,

113
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,970
G, say and play with me,

114
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:22,290
G A Bb C D E F G A Bb C D E F G A B C.

115
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,760
Okay, that was form two,

116
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,910
I'm gonna quickly go through the other forms as well.

117
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,855
We won't spend as much time on them,

118
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:29,800
but here's the third form,

119
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,270
starts on the third part of the scale, the third step of the scale,

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,580
I put my first finger on this A now,

121
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,740
okay, now remember the goal of all this is learning your neck,

122
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,830
so I would encourage you

123
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,900
not just to learn the patterns,

124
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,460
because everybody can learn the patterns,

125
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,735
I'm talking about learning the neck,

126
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:46,970
learn what these notes are,

127
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,980
Say them as you're playing them,

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,790
you may not be able to do it the first time through,

129
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,190
but this is the idea of it,

130
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,360
say the notes,

131
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,620
realize that this is an A, this is an F, this is A Bb,

132
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,840
make that connection between your fingers,

133
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,510
what you're saying and also thinking about the scale,

134
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,090
there's three different things going on.

135
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,080
Here we go,

136
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,030
here the third form,

137
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,670
ready go,

138
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:24,880
D E F G A Bb C D E shift F G A Bb C D.

139
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,210
Next form, starts on the fourth,

140
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:45,460
E F G A B C D E F G A Bb C D E,

141
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,220
okay, we're almost to the top now.

142
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,520
Okay, now let's start on the fifth, on that C,

143
00:08:52,350 --> 00:09:06,640
C D E F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb C D E F.

144
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,440
Two more,

145
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,790
starts on the D,

146
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:23,675
D E F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb C D E F.

147
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:25,420
And the last one starting on this E,

148
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:37,060
E F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb C D E F G A.

149
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,380
Now we have gone through all the forms now,

150
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,610
here's what you need to do,

151
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,230
go through all of those forms,

152
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,480
learn those seven different forms,

153
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,070
and then start doing them in different keys,

154
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,550
you'll notice you'll start bouncing around different places on the neck.

155
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,810
Let me show you a couple of tricks you can do with these

156
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,740
and what makes these three on a string scales so helpful, when you play.

157
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,630
Here's an exercise you can do,

158
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,670
you go up at one and down in the other,

159
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,195
up at one, down in the other,

160
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:08,640
we did this on pentatonic scales,

161
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,000
let's see how it works out with three note on a string scales.

162
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,980
Starting down here in first position again,

163
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,420
it'll be something like this,

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,820
now I switch and shift positions

165
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,100
and I go down in the second form

166
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,970
and I go up

167
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,930
and so on.

168
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,370
Now you can also do hammer-ons and pull-offs, when you're doing this,

169
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,645
okay, so you do hammer-ons ascending

170
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,840
and of course pull-offs as you're descending,

171
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,580
hammer-ons, so I just,

172
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,680
if I did that on this first form,

173
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,270
I just play the first note

174
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:07,760
and then hammer on the other two,

175
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,490
let's shift up and do our pull-offs down,

176
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,220
takes a little bit of a practice to get control with your hammer-ons and pull-offs,

177
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,610
but here's, here's one of the wonderful guitar tricks you can do with these now.

178
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,700
Okay, I'm going to speed that up,

179
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,170
okay, and I'm gonna turn my metronome on here

180
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,720
and we're gonna do triplets,

181
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,425
okay, what are triplets,

182
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,510
let's talk about that first,

183
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,630
well, eighth notes, there's two per beat,

184
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,910
sixteenth notes, there's four per beat,

185
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,610
now we're going to talk about the in between one, triplets,

186
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,310
with triplets, there are only three per beat,

187
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,565
think of it like this,

188
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:46,560
if here is my beat,

189
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,490
eighth notes would be eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth,

190
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,440
sixteenth would be,

191
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,070
triplets would be,

192
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,010
one, two, three, one two three, one two three, one two three,

193
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,760
saturday, saturday, saturday, saturday,

194
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,955
sometimes you help putting things to syllables helps out like that,

195
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:19,100
that's what triplets are.

196
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,920
So if I have a measure of eighth notes,

197
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,655
followed by a measure of triplets,

198
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:28,560
it would be eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth,

199
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,570
triplet, triplet, triplet, triplet,

200
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,520
see how triplets work.

201
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,180
Now let's put some triplets with our three note on a string scales.

202
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,340
Okay, this is pretty slow, this is 60 beats per minute,

203
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,620
and I do my hammer-ons and I'm gonna do triplets,

204
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,850
so it be something like this,

205
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:52,870
go,

206
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,970
good, let's crank it up a little bit,

207
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,140
maybe up to 72 here,

208
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,710
I do the same thing again, go,

209
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,445
now, what works out great with these is

210
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm not actually having to pick,

211
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,230
which picking is the hardest part of building speed,

212
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,650
not necessarily the fingering,

213
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,580
it's your picking hand,

214
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,640
that's the one thing that starts screwing up after a while.

215
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,540
So let's raise it up a little bit,

216
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,640
let's put up in 100 here,

217
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,850
so the triplets are like,

218
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,935
okay, and then you would go on, so on.

219
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:04,790
Crank it up a little bit more,

220
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,130
let's do like maybe 120,

221
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:17,155
okay, I'm going pretty fast at that point,

222
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,900
I still have room to go,

223
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,630
because I haven't maxed out my picking hand yet.

224
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,170
So let's go up a little bit more, 144,

225
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,885
suddenly, I've got a really cool way,

226
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,510
I can play through scales

227
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,000
and get a lot of good distance on the neck,

228
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,250
all I need to do is kick in, maybe a little distortion,

229
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,320
let's throw a little delay on that,

230
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,660
get this going one more time

231
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,520
and turn that off a little bit.

232
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,220
Okay, all [] flipping off those three note on the string scales,

233
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,070
it all starts with learning your seven positions of it,

234
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,650
yeah, seven positions, it's a lot,

235
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,315
took me about three months to get it all,

236
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:33,800
but every day I would go through these in all the different keys

237
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,840
and it would take [] the start,

238
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,510
but eventually you get to sing those patterns more and more,

239
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,730
say and play the notes all the way up the neck

240
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,590
and you'll learn the neck of your instrument

241
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,750
and get a really cool thing that you can do,

242
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,950
and you can solo with using hammer-on and pull-offs for these three string scales.

243
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,140
Okay, welcome to the how music works section,

244
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,390
here we're gonna learn a real helpful little bit complex of topic,

245
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,910
but we're into, I mean we're at what, session 17,

246
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,710
we're into complex stuff now,

247
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,400
this is one of the most helpful things is seventh chords,

248
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,170
we've talked about triads, majors, minors, diminished, augmented,

249
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,660
now I'm going to just going to add one more third on top of that triad,

250
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,690
and we're gonna make a seventh chord out of it.

251
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,140
Okay, now you've already been playing seventh chords, C7, D7, G7,

252
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,090
now, we're gonna talk about the different kinds of seventh chords

253
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,540
and what exactly they are in music.

254
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,310
When I say a seventh chord, that involves four tones,

255
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,070
the first, the third, the fifth and the seventh degree of the major scale.

256
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,910
Now that I've got more notes,

257
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,365
I've got more different permutations,

258
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,390
that I can have with those different notes,

259
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,780
so, I end up with a bunch of different combinations,

260
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,580
so let's go through those really quickly.

261
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:53,750
The first one, one, three, five and seven is called a major seventh chord,

262
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,880
whether it's in C F Bb, whatever,

263
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,580
if it's a major seventh chord,

264
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,910
that major, very important major seventh chord,

265
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,840
then you're dealing with the first, third, fifth and seventh degree of that C scale

266
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,515
or whatever scale you're in,

267
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:12,310
if I am in C,

268
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,770
it'd be a C E G and a B,

269
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,530
that would be the notes in A C major seven.

270
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,930
Okay, the next one is a minor seventh,

271
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,475
well, what is that minor telling us,

272
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:27,310
that's telling us triad information,

273
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,170
so instead of one, three, five,

274
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,200
it's now one, b3, five,

275
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,380
now, let's talk about the seventh,

276
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,450
it's a b7,

277
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,500
why is it a b7.

278
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,970
Well, here is the rule,

279
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,080
always use a b7, except for two exceptions,

280
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,100
Okay, the first of which we're going to talk about,

281
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,160
and the second, which I'll talk about in a minute.

282
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,900
The first exception is our major seventh,

283
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,120
when I say the word major seventh,

284
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,365
I've got to physically say the word major seventh

285
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:03,790
or in your chord it'll have an maj7

286
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,740
or even sometimes you'll see a triangle,

287
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,030
that's the abbreviation, [] Jazz abbreviation for major seventh.

288
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,520
Okay, it has to physically say major seventh,

289
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,435
otherwise, if it doesn't say that,

290
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,570
it's a flat seventh, always,

291
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,320
except for one other exception, I'll tell you about in a second,

292
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,550
but all the time it's a flat seventh,

293
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,680
unless it says major seventh,

294
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,390
okay, so C minor seventh would then be C Eb G,

295
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,470
and then the flat at seventh would be a Bb,

296
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,185
if I played it,

297
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:37,730
it would be C Eb G Bb.

298
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,145
Okay, next one is a dominant 7th,

299
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:44,115
now you don't hear, hear it referred to as a dominant seventh very much,

300
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:45,560
that's kind of the technical name of it,

301
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,800
when you just say I want to C seventh and F seventh,

302
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,840
not a minor seventh, not a major seventh, just seventh,

303
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,700
when it's just a seventh, it's a dominant seventh.

304
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,160
The formula for that is one, three, five, flated seventh,

305
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,570
so if I'm in C, it would be C E G Bb.

306
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,430
Now, okay,

307
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,680
next one is augmented seventh,

308
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,740
that would be an augmented triad, C E G#,

309
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,140
sharp the fifth, right, one, three, sharp five

310
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,550
and still what kind of seventh, flatted seventh,

311
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,080
C E G# Bb.

312
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,110
Okay, now here comes our two,

313
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,575
this last one, the diminished chord, has two little branches of it,

314
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:34,720
let's talk about the first one,

315
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,240
if I want a fully diminished seventh chord,

316
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,430
diminished tells us one, flat three, flat five, just like the triad,

317
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,770
now, what happens with the seventh,

318
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,100
Well, here's our second exception from our rule,

319
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,430
it is a double flatted seventh,

320
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,315
when you're in a fully diminished chord,

321
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:56,145
it is a double flated seventh,

322
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:57,020
why is that,

323
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,030
I don't know, that's just how it is.

324
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,145
The formula for a fully diminished chord is

325
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:08,970
C, excuse me, one, flat three, flat five, double flat seven,

326
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,260
C Eb Gb Bbb,

327
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,360
but Steve, isn't that an A,

328
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,330
yes, I know that's an A, you know that's an A,

329
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,790
but in theory land which is where we're right now,

330
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,680
it is a Bbb,

331
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,790
okay.

332
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,830
Now, there's also his sister is a half diminished,

333
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,410
the formula for a half diminished is one, flat three, flat five, flat seven,

334
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,430
I know there's a lot of formulas I'm throwing at you,

335
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,990
that's the last of them, okay,

336
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,590
so what is that,

337
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,410
we've got, what, six different forms there,

338
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:51,200
half diminished, one, flat three, flat five, double flat, or excuse me, regular flat seven,

339
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,340
so in C, it be C Eb Gb Bb.

340
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,740
Okay, here's the rule,

341
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,510
everything's always a flat seventh

342
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,960
except for when it says physically says major seventh

343
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,060
or it's a fully diminished seventh and then it would be a double flat.

344
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,200
Okay, so let's do a little bit of practice,

345
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,320
what would be a Cmaj7,

346
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,660
well, the formula would be one, three, five, seven,

347
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,290
so in C, it would be a C E G B,

348
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,250
what would be a Cm7,

349
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,170
what's the formula, one, flat three, five, flat seven,

350
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,710
C Eb G Bb,

351
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,620
what about a C7,

352
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,160
no problem, one, three, five, flat seven, C E G Bb.

353
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,175
Okay, well Steve,

354
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:47,700
what, what on earth good could there be from all of this math in the seventh chords,

355
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,505
well, as I'm reading through a chord progression

356
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:53,510
and here's an, let's say an Em7 stare me in the face

357
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,430
and I want to solo over the top of that,

358
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,980
I need to know what notes are in that Em7,

359
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,680
I can't just fake it,

360
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,390
that's what I did when I was, that's the baby pool,

361
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,660
when you just kind of fake it

362
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,270
and you you play something in the key,

363
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,880
now I want to know exactly what those notes are,

364
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,600
in an Em7, that's one, flat three, five, flat seven, E G B and D,

365
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,230
here comes that chord,

366
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,965
it's time for me to solo,

367
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:21,040
the guy points to me, I'm ready to solo,

368
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,830
the four tones I know are super safe,

369
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,220
are E G B and D,

370
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,350
because I know the chord tones.

371
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,630
So yes, those chords are coming by,

372
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,660
but you start thinking of those chords as combinations of tones,

373
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,750
which tones are common throughout all those different chords,

374
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,170
and you start being able to understand how to build a good solo.

375
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,720
Soloing is coming up in one of the later sessions,

376
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,310
but this is the beginning of it

377
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,940
and you have to have this harmonic understanding underneath your belt,

378
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,860
so where when you see an Fm7,

379
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,490
you know what that is and what formula goes with it.

380
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,540
Okay.

381
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,330
Here's our assignment for this session.

382
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,370
I want you to practice your three note on a string scales,

383
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,260
the full range of the instrument,

384
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,160
in various keys,

385
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,780
try and do them in all the keys,

386
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,160
if you're interested in learning,

387
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,410
and if you're this deep into this series,

388
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,060
you're pretty serious about learning,

389
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,770
so I encourage you to do them in all the keys,

390
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,960
say and play the notes,

391
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,860
learn the neck,

392
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,865
there's no easy way to do it,

393
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:24,055
you got to say them and play them

394
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,980
and understand what these notes are,

395
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,980
I wish I could give you a magic formula for doing it,

396
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,440
but a lot of it is sitting on your couch and doing this for a lot of times

397
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,160
until you can get those where you understand where these notes are,

398
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,560
so the key to opening that door of knowledge,

399
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,690
I found is through these three note on string scales,

400
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,020
say and play all keys, the full range of the instrument.

401
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,070
Now then you get into the guitar playing fun stuff,

402
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,640
do the hammer, practice the hammer-ons and the pull-offs with them,

403
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,350
eventually, you'll be able to get him going pretty fast,

404
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,540
try not going from beginning to end,

405
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,430
try somewhere starting somewhere in the middle,

406
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,410
going up a little bit, coming down a little bit,

407
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,220
get that control over those hammer-ons and pull-offs,

408
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,410
slow, steady is where you want them,

409
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,020
incorporate triplets into that as well.

410
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,400
There's plenty of exercise in your book for you to start on,

411
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,450
and Jam Along exercises for you to get some practice in the soloing, which is coming up.

412
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,520
Okay, I'll see you at the workshop.

413
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,950
In our workshop time,

414
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,380
I want to cover several key things,

415
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,390
three note on a string scales.

416
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,600
Let's go through that first form very slowly,

417
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,460
let me turn on my metronome here,

418
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,040
we're going to start an F, down here at the first form,

419
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,340
try and say and play the notes

420
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,200
as we do them together,

421
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,210
ready, go,

422
00:24:46,680 --> 00:25:02,050
F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb C,

423
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,080
that was a little fast,

424
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,850
let me slow that down a little bit,

425
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,990
give you a chance to catch up,

426
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,990
now, a little bit slower, ready, play,

427
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:19,710
F G A Bb C D, stretch out that hand,

428
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:32,310
E F G A Bb C D E F G A Bb,

429
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:33,810
okay.

430
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,990
Now let's transpose that to a different key,

431
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,360
let's say I'm doing it in the key of G,

432
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm going to move everything up a whole step,

433
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,370
now I'm going to do that same form in the key of G,

434
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,780
I want you to say the notes,

435
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,590
ready, play,

436
00:25:48,320 --> 00:26:07,540
G A B C D E F# G A B C D E F# G A B C,

437
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,245
let's do it one more,

438
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:10,300
let's do it in the key of C,

439
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,370
no problem,

440
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,590
move my first finger up here to C,

441
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,390
ready go,

442
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:37,680
C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G,

443
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,720
now let's speed up a little bit,

444
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,150
okay,

445
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,100
let's go back to, let's do it in Bb,

446
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,530
okay, ready go,

447
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,570
Bb C D,

448
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,450
speed it up a little bit more

449
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,950
and I'm going to start an F,

450
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,150
actually, let me put it down, we'll do it in triplets,

451
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,910
okay, start F, we're gonna go ascending one way,

452
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,825
shift up and descending the next

453
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:20,300
and I'm gonna work my way all the way up the neck in triplets,

454
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,670
ready, go,

455
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,260
now I went the entire full length of the instrument,

456
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,260
from the lowest note, I was able to hit in that key

457
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,780
to the highest note I was able to hit in that key,

458
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,370
that's what I would like for you to do

459
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,160
in all these other forms and in the other keys as well.

460
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,340
Let's do it one more time,

461
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,140
let me speed it up a little bit,

462
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,940
now I'm gonna do it, let's say in C,

463
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,405
but I'm gonna start down here,

464
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:49,780
so I gotta start in a different form, okay,

465
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,065
but I'm gonna be in the key of C,

466
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:51,970
let's do hammer-ons,

467
00:28:52,050 --> 00:29:33,335
ready, go,

468
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:34,330
that's as high as I can get,

469
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,180
Okay.

470
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,550
Do those on all the keys

471
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,950
try and say and play the notes as you're doing them,

472
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,450
that's where you start learning.

473
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,870
Let's spell a couple of seventh chords before we go,

474
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,020
okay, what would be Dm7,

475
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,140
what the formula, one, flat three, five, flat seven,

476
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,960
plug those numbers into a D scale,

477
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,010
you end up with D F A and C,

478
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,510
what would an Amaj7 be,

479
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,060
A C# E G#,

480
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,030
what would Bb7 be,

481
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,530
Bb D F Ab.

482
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,245
As you're looking at music,

483
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:30,095
try and always be spelling these seventh chords as they come by,

484
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,020
now that you know what notes are involved in them,

485
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,970
this is a long process of learning these scales,

486
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,620
but it's very, very helpful,

487
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,430
play and say the notes,

488
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,480
give yourself some time to do this,

489
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,010
this is gonna take some weeks to get this underneath your your belt,

490
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,860
but perseverance will pay off in what you're doing,

491
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,970
I'll see you next time.
