1
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,880
Okay, welcome, we're going to talk about playing the Blues,

2
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,760
musically, the Blues is a couple of different things,

3
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,420
it involves single notes,

4
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,880
we're going to add some notes to the major scale,

5
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,290
some notes we're going to delete,

6
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,700
some notes we're just going to adjust,

7
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,830
and it also involves chords

8
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,020
of a very specific chord progression,

9
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,740
that's twelve measures long called the Blues chord progression,

10
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,390
twelve bar Blues, you may have heard of that.

11
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,300
First thing we're talking about are the Blues notes,

12
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,780
what are the Blues notes,

13
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,980
let's talk about that first,

14
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:48,440
the Blues notes are the flatted third, the flatted fifth and the flatted seventh of the major scale,

15
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,320
the blues scale is taken, is derived from that major scale,

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,790
so if you look at your major scale,

17
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,140
we have one two three four five six and seven.

18
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,690
Now, we're just going to add and adjust a couple of those notes,

19
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,280
we're going to add the flatted third,

20
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,710
so now the blues scale would be one two, flatted third,

21
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,780
you can still have the other third in there,

22
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,070
then we have fourth,

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,560
then we squeeze in that flatted fifth,

24
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,890
then we have the fifth, the sixth,

25
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,150
then we had the flatted seventh and we take out the regular seventh,

26
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,560
so in the Blues,

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,640
we never use that normal seventh, that regular seventh,

28
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,170
part of that is,

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
if we do that,

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,500
we lose completely the whole tonality of playing the Blues,

31
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,780
so that's why we have to keep that flatted seventh there.

32
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,840
So let's talk about two of those specific pitches first,

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,970
the flatted third and the flatted seventh,

34
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,000
flatted seventh is probably the most critical to get that Blues sound.

35
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,830
So if we're in the C scale, the c major scale,

36
00:02:49,250 --> 00:03:03,050
one is C, two is D, E F G A B and C,

37
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,700
that would be the major scale,

38
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,230
now when I add those blues notes in it,

39
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,020
I've got C D,

40
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,300
I throw this Eb in there,

41
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:24,370
E F and Gb G A Bb and C,

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,250
now that's kind of the musical,

43
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,290
you when you're looking at a musical notation

44
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,230
just to understand what the Blues notes are made up of,

45
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,840
now, you don't have to have all of those notes in there,

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,620
you don't have to completely play that what nine or ten note scale,

47
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,820
in order for it to work,

48
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,270
each pick and choose and you can add some and delete some others,

49
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,680
now I'm a guitar player,

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,880
so all guitar players,

51
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,200
we like the easy way out,

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,530
so the easiest way we can squeeze these Blues notes in

53
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,330
and I don't want to have to learn another scale,

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,220
I want to take these scales that I already know

55
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,300
and be able to use them

56
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,860
and still get some [] out of them,

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,210
there's where some of the beauty comes in learning our pentatonic scales,

58
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,010
and now we're going to use them,

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,660
with the Blues progression.

60
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,460
Okay, so if I take a C minor pentatonic scale,

61
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,450
look at those notes,

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,170
I've got a C, an Eb, an F, a G and a Bb,

63
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,500
well, already in that scale,

64
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,570
I've got almost all of the keynotes in there,

65
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,510
I've dropped the second, I've dropped the sixth in there,

66
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,170
but that's okay

67
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,180
and Blues you really don't need those too much, anyway,

68
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,370
it's still good to have them in,

69
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,380
but an easy way to get started with it is

70
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,620
just playing the minor pentatonic form,

71
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,940
when you're doing Blues,

72
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,620
if we're in c let's say,

73
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,260
I would play a C minor pentatonic form with it,

74
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,030
and that will make it sound bluesy,

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,650
let me show you what I'm talking about.

76
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,700
So if I'm playing a C minor pentatonic scale,

77
00:04:51,090 --> 00:05:01,620
it would be up here at the what eight fret,

78
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,180
okay, just a regular C minor pentatonic

79
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,930
and take it down,

80
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,440
okay, regular first for minor pentatonic,

81
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,220
okay, now when I added to a Blues form,

82
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,650
let's see what happens,

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,510
let's get our, let's get our loop going again,

84
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,700
and I'm going to throw this C minor pentatonic,

85
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,630
and you can hear how it kind of fits and starts sounding bluesy.

86
00:05:30,510 --> 00:06:04,830
Okay, now that was basically the C minor pentatonic

87
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,360
and I'm getting double use out of it,

88
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm using it as my Blues scale as well,

89
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,740
now it doesn't have a couple of the notes,

90
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,540
it doesn't have that flatted fifth in it,

91
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,900
but basically that's it,

92
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,370
if I wanted to add that flatted fifth to the minor pentatonic form,

93
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,380
I just have to squeeze that note in there.

94
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,160
So let's take a look at that form,

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,230
I've got the first pentatonic form,

96
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,490
we said we're going to play it,

97
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,850
now let's go back and play

98
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,220
and play an A minor just where where we're at,

99
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,570
and I'm going to play this in A minor,

100
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,970
but I'm going to squeeze that flatted fifth in there,

101
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,010
okay, you see if you can follow along with me,

102
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,230
here we go, first fourth,

103
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,400
first, here's that flatted fifth that's diamond note,

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,280
okay that's gonna be our flatted fifth note,

105
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,020
keep going through it,

106
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:05,330
here comes another one, on the Eb.

107
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,110
Okay, so if I did that fast,

108
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,510
if I take it down,

109
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,170
see how that flatted fifth really gives it that bluesy sound,

110
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,620
one thing, on that flatted fifth, it's so,

111
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,320
how shall I say,

112
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,630
it's got so much tension in that note,

113
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,450
that you don't want to land on it for a very long time,

114
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,400
you kind of throw it in there,

115
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,170
speckle it in there a little bit,

116
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,520
but you don't want to land on it,

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,930
if I land on it,

118
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,060
it's too dissonant and it doesn't work.

119
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,480
The flatted third works well, the flatted seventh works well,

120
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,240
the flatted fifth is a little bit so strong,

121
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,100
you don't want to really land on it too much,

122
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,960
use it, but just kind of sneak into it,

123
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,130
as you're using it up and down.

124
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,920
Okay, now that's some of the Blues notes,

125
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,080
that that are derived from the major scale,

126
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,580
let's talk about the other half of it,

127
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,800
which is the Blues chord progression.

128
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,710
Okay, it is 12 measures long,

129
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,620
and it goes in a very specific way,

130
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,380
there's many different versions of it,

131
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,900
are ways you can derive different things from it,

132
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,510
here it is in its most basic form.

133
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,400
The first four bars are the one chord,

134
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,650
in any key,

135
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,570
if I'm in C, it would be a C chord,

136
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,860
if I'm an F, would be an F chord.

137
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,980
Next, on bar five and six,

138
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,040
I go to the four of whatever key I'm in,

139
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,210
if I'm in C,

140
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,500
I just count up the major scale, C D E F,

141
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,860
and I play the F chord for two bars.

142
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,090
Got it,

143
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,550
so I've got the one chord for four bars,

144
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,430
the four chord for two bars,

145
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,050
and then for the next two bars, I go back to the one chord.

146
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,540
So, I've got four the one chord,

147
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,920
two with the four chord,

148
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,980
then back to two with the one chord,

149
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,150
the last four bars, I use the five chord,

150
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,910
which in C, would be the G, right,

151
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,610
C D E F G,

152
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,620
G is the fifth step in the scale,

153
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,350
so I'd use the G or the five,

154
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,210
the next measure I'd go to four,

155
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,430
or in C, would be an F,

156
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,970
and then I go back to one for two bars.

157
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,330
So it's twelve bars all put together,

158
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,710
let's go through it again,

159
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,220
the first, first for our one chords,

160
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,060
then in bar five, I have the four chords,

161
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,410
then in bar seven, I have the one chord,

162
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,650
and then I go five, four, two bars of one.

163
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,340
Add that all up together,

164
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,700
you get twelve bars, twelve bar Blues.

165
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,610
Let's listen to that example one more time

166
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,840
and see if you can hear those chords changing between one and four.

167
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,040
Okay, here we go,

168
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,970
starts on one chord and we'll do this for four measures,

169
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,440
here comes the four chord,

170
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,310
back to the one,

171
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,770
here comes five,

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,020
it comes four,

173
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,150
back to one.

174
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,250
Okay, now we're in C,

175
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,570
so I'm gonna play it in C,

176
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,800
starts on a C chord,

177
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,340
F chord now,

178
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,380
C chord,

179
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:52,100
G F C.

180
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,960
So that's the Blues chord progression in C or a C Blues,

181
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,300
now you've learned the notes, the Blues notes,

182
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,610
that we can apply into our C scale

183
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,800
and we can also use our C minor pentatonic

184
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
as an easy way to find notes,

185
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,920
and we've also learned the Blues chord progression,

186
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,930
now let's take a look at some triads.

187
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,770
Okay, welcome to the how music works section,

188
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,010
in this section, we're going to talk about triads,

189
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,430
all the chords that we've learned so far are

190
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,700
all based off of a certain type of a connection pattern with the major scale,

191
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,140
it's called triad,

192
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,520
a triad in its most simplest form is just a combination of three notes,

193
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,780
hence the name triad.

194
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,020
Okay, now we pull these notes from the major scale,

195
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,050
okay, you see your C major scale there,

196
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,350
now the notes that we use to make chords

197
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,340
out of those are the triad,

198
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,810
that were going to use for our purposes,

199
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,330
we're going to pull and adjust the one, the three and the five,

200
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:05,140
if I'm in c that would be the C, E and G.

201
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,200
Okay, now there are four different types of triads,

202
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,970
that you need to worry about as a guitar player,

203
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,930
and they've got four different names that go with them,

204
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,820
the major triad,

205
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,640
its formula is built on the one, the three and the five,

206
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,440
the first, third and fifth notes pulled out of a scale, major scale,

207
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,150
so if I'm in C, it would be a C, an E and a G,

208
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,670
if I'm in F, it would be an F, an A and a C,

209
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,990
the formula for a major triad, one three five.

210
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,890
Next one is minor,

211
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:46,110
a minor triad is one, flat three, five,

212
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,630
I take that third and I lower it a half step,

213
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,070
so if I'm in C, it would be C, then Eb and G,

214
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,110
if I'm at F, would be F Ab and C.

215
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,060
Okay, the next one is augmented,

216
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:07,510
that's, that specific triads formula is one three sharp five,

217
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,330
so in C, it would be C E G#,

218
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,800
I raise that fifth up.

219
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,060
The next one is diminished,

220
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,160
and diminished, the formula is one, flat three, flat five,

221
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,490
C Eb Gb.

222
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,800
So we've covered four different types,

223
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,740
a major triad is one three five,

224
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,460
a minor triad is one flat three five,

225
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,760
an augmented triad is one three sharp five

226
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,810
and a diminished triad is one, flat three, flat five.

227
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,600
Okay, now let's take a listen to some of these triads

228
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,870
and see if you can hear train [] and train our ear

229
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,420
to hear the difference between major and minor and diminished and augmented.

230
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,000
So if I'm in C,

231
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,620
C major triad would be C E and G,

232
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,410
which would sound like this, C E G,

233
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,620
minor triad would be C Eb G,

234
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,570
here's major, here's minor,

235
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,720
can you hear the difference, when that third goes down,

236
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,780
augmented would be C E G#,

237
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,710
okay, major and minor are the ones that we use almost all the time,

238
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,360
every now and then we throw in augmented,

239
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,950
every now and then we throw in diminished,

240
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,370
but the most significant ones you're gonna run across our majors and minors.

241
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,110
The augmented is C E G#,

242
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,950
the last one is the diminished, would be C Eb Gb,

243
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,590
hear the difference in that,

244
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,730
so they go through them all,

245
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:07,520
C major, C minor, C augmented, C diminished.

246
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,890
Okay, they don't sound too musical put by themselves,

247
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,240
when you put them in a chord progression,

248
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,530
that's when it starts making sense.

249
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,370
Okay, here's our assignment for this session,

250
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,170
your assignment is to practice the penta tonic forms with the Blues notes

251
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,930
in all of the keys the full range of the instrument,

252
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,560
now I showed you the first pentatonic form back in our session,

253
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,500
but there's also, remember there's also four other forms,

254
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,610
five of them put together

255
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,680
with your squeezing that extra note in it,

256
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,080
so get those underneath your fingers be able to play them,

257
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,510
the full range of the instrument in any key.

258
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,500
Next is memorize the Blues chord progression,

259
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,760
that's probably the easiest thing,

260
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,960
four bars of one, two bars of four, two bars of one, a five, a four and two ones,

261
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,970
that's a good thing to commit to memory,

262
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,770
think about it in different keys,

263
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,570
be able to get a handle on

264
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,370
the different keys and different chords,

265
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,950
that go in those different keys through that Blues progression,

266
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,360
play the Blues chord progressions in the various keys from the exercises in your book,

267
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,640
also practice soloing using the Blues pentatonic form,

268
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,190
over the Blues progressions in the Jam tracks,

269
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,170
there's lots of things for you to work on,

270
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,500
lots of opportunities for you to practice and get better at it,

271
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,150
so I encourage you to keep doing that,

272
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,560
so I'll see you next time.

273
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,510
Okay, for our workshop time today,

274
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,040
let's review a couple things,

275
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,890
our Blues notes are the flatted third, the flatted fifth and the flatted seventh,

276
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,380
derived from that major scale in C,

277
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,360
the flatted third would be an Eb,

278
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,660
the flatted fifth would be a Gb,

279
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,150
flatted seventh would be a Bb.

280
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,160
Okay, remember we can use our minor pentatonic form

281
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,070
to cover almost all of our Blues notes

282
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,790
and the [], in the chord progressions that we need to cover

283
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,770
by using that minor pentatonic,

284
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,090
so if I want to sound bluesy,

285
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,650
let's say you're playing Blues in C,

286
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,410
I just start playing my C minor pentatonic

287
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,110
and that's when it starts paying off for me.

288
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,600
Okay, let's go through that minor pentatonic form,

289
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
we're going to start in A, A minor pentatonic,

290
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,720
we're going to go through the different forms adding those Blues notes.

291
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,410
Okay, so here we are in the first position adding the Blues notes,

292
00:17:49,930 --> 00:18:02,270
ready go,

293
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:10,430
let's go down,

294
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,400
let's do it one more time,

295
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:26,510
ready, play.

296
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,100
So let's say I wanted to play an F Blues,

297
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,730
okay, so song comes up, it's an F

298
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,840
and I want to sound bluesy,

299
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,120
I go down to my F minor pentatonic

300
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,120
and I can derive notes out of that scale,

301
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,520
let's practice that scale one time in F,

302
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,410
slowly and then we'll do it faster,

303
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,270
so you can get it underneath your fingers,

304
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:21,310
ready, go,

305
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,650
okay, a little bit faster,

306
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:31,990
ready, go.

307
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,810
Great, now [] at Bb,

308
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:57,520
ready, go

309
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,190
great, now let's do it in E,

310
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,800
well, I can't go low, I start running out of notes,

311
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,910
so I gotta go high,

312
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:16,930
ready, go.

313
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,850
Great, now remember what a Blues chord progression is,

314
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,610
four bars of one, two bars of four,

315
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:32,220
back to one for two bars, five, four, and then one for two bars.

316
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,230
Okay, so if we're playing in C,

317
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,730
it would be like this,

318
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,600
now let's play,

319
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,580
I'm going to turn the loop on again

320
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,030
and let's play a C, let's just do a C7,

321
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,270
okay, going to an F7, G7,

322
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,250
we'll just add seven to all these major chords,

323
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,200
for this purposes right now,

324
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,880
so let's do the example in C,

325
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,080
F7,

326
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:08,670
C,

327
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,590
G7,

328
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,870
let's switch some different forms around,

329
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,800
two C7 here,

330
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,360
F7,

331
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,350
C7,

332
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,900
G7,

333
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,580
F7,

334
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,890
C7.

335
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,690
Great, now we're gonna do it in E,

336
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,360
and we're going to practice the Blues progression in E,

337
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,410
you ready,

338
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,610
let's go,

339
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,530
then A7,

340
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:20,410
you don't always have to have the same rhythm,

341
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,110
try and find a different form to play.

342
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,510
Okay, this time we're going to the E Blues

343
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,570
and I want you to solo using that minor pentatonic form,

344
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,840
over this E chord progression,

345
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,100
I'll play the chords,

346
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,560
but you go ahead and try and solo over the top of it.

347
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,730
Okay, let's try it,

348
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,140
just use that E minor pentatonic form,

349
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,110
through those blues if you want to.

350
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,210
Now you gotta remember,

351
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,760
when you're doing scales and you're trying soloing,

352
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,850
the main thing about soloing is making music,

353
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,710
not just going through your scales,

354
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,290
it doesn't sound very much like music,

355
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,900
when you're just going,

356
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,390
that doesn't make very good music,

357
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,980
you need to take parts of those,

358
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,960
those are just kind of the colors that you're using,

359
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,360
those are the building blocks that you're building a solo out of,

360
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,760
so try not thinking of it, try not think of it so linearly,

361
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,410
don't think of it as a scale,

362
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,270
think of it as you're just grabbing these pieces

363
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,620
and trying to make something out of it.

364
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,470
Okay, we're gonna play one more time,

365
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,790
I'm going to play a phrase

366
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,990
and then you're going to play a phrase

367
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,680
to see if you can play what I played right after me,

368
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,520
let's try it.

369
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,880
Now you play,

370
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:16,420
let's do another one.

371
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:53,180
Great, soloing is all about getting your creative ideas

372
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,700
and being able to make something musical out of them,

373
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,290
I encourage you to keep trying,

374
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,660
keep experimenting with those Jam tracks

375
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,150
and the different chord progressions that we have laid out for you,

376
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,620
the more practice you get with them,

377
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,270
the better your ear is going to be,

378
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,580
at hearing the things that you want to play

379
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,680
and be able to translate them through your fingers,

380
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,790
we'll see you next time.
