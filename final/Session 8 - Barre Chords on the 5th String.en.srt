00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,970
Hi, welcome to session eight of learn and master guitar,

2
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,610
here we're going to talk about some very key concepts

3
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,520
in your guitar learning your guitar knowledge,

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,920
we've covered the barre chords on the sixth string,

5
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,860
now we're going to cover the barre chords on the fifth string,

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,230
there are barre chords on other strings,

7
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,090
but generally once you've covered the sixth and fifth,

8
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,040
you've pretty much got a good handle on what you need to do,

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,120
so you're halfway there,

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,000
if you've made it through this far through the six string barre chords,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,390
we've got half more, five more forms are going to learn the five string barre chords

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,640
and then you are set and ready to go.

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,300
Okay in our music, how music works section,

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,520
we're gonna cover a couple of key concepts

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,340
dealing with keys and key signatures,

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,810
how to determine the key,

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,980
how to how to drive that information from the major scale

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,660
and then a very important information

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,320
as you begin playing with other musicians and playing in different settings is

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,310
how to determine the key from just looking at a piece of music,

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,160
okay, so we're going to learn that skill to a couple of tricks for that.

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,270
And that's basically all we're going to cover this time,

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,280
lots of exciting things to learn this week

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,800
as you seek to become the musician, that you've always wanted to be.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:33,200
So, I'll see you there.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,010
Okay, the first thing we need to do,

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,950
as we as we need to cover these fifth string barre forms,

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,060
that we're going to come up on,

29
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,860
because we need to talk about hand position again,

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,390
just review proper hand position is so vital to what we're doing,

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,980
what you need to remember keep that first finger straight,

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,130
if you're angling back on you're a neck of your guitar like this,

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,590
you're not going to get the power that you need,

34
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,020
even though you think you're getting a whole lot of power,

35
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,420
but you're not getting the power where you need,

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,770
which is in that first finger,

37
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,780
make sure that first finger is nice and strong,

38
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,120
okay, you need to take your finger to the gym

39
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,990
for these little muscles by doing those finger exercises,

40
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,220
that's what toughens them up

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,800
and where it can do what it needs to do,

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,720
you'll find that these fifth string barre forms

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,180
are a little bit easier than the six string barre forms, that we've covered,

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,210
make sure that wrist is forward and low,

45
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,190
the [] is to bring it back,

46
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,690
you want it down,

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,880
not completely whacked out, not uncomfortable,

48
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,020
but it needs to, it needs to be good solid down, when you're playing,

49
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,550
to have a good hand position,

50
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,820
remember your hand position should still be balanced our fingers,

51
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,010
even though we're playing barre chords,

52
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,100
they still should be coming at, not angled like this,

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,690
but coming straight on, like that.

54
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,150
Okay.

55
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,600
Now, when you move between chords,

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,710
let's say I'm going from a G chord to an A chord,

57
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,690
I don't want to make the G chord

58
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,240
and then completely reset to make A chord,

59
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,390
I want to shift, not reset my fingers,

60
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,850
when I'm moving these chords in between positions,

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
if I go from a G to an A,

62
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,960
I just lift the pressure off

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,490
and bring it up to an A,

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,560
put the pressure back down again,

65
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,820
you want to try and avoid,

66
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,830
as we're getting now, more and more chords

67
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,520
not to have to reset and take your hand off,

68
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,170
find the place, then reform the chord,

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,700
just move to where you need to go,

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,590
keep the hands basically your fingers basically in the same position

71
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,550
and then you're ready to hit.

72
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,290
Okay, now let's talk about the notes on the fifth string,

73
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,310
that's where it all starts,

74
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,050
remember how we did the notes on the sixth string,

75
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,150
now we're going to learn the notes on the fifth string.

76
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,470
Okay, this is the A string,

77
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,300
same rules still apply,

78
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,430
half step between what two pairs of notes, E and F and B and C,

79
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,660
so let's count it up on the A string,

80
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,170
you ready,

81
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:06,400
A, B, C, you should already know those,

82
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,130
now we need a whole step up to a D,

83
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,640
now we want to go to a E, that's a whole step,

84
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,740
now we want to go to F, that's whatever half steps,

85
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,330
need to go to G, that would be a whole step

86
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:28,990
and A, up here at the twelfth fret, that would be a whole step,

87
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,580
remember the magical twelve fret,

88
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,170
that's where everything starts repeating,

89
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,210
so that's where we would expect an A to be,

90
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,110
okay, is right there at that twelve fret.

91
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,550
Let's do it one more time,

92
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:55,490
A B C D E F G A.

93
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,600
Let's go ahead and go back down

94
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,580
you try and say and play them as we're doing this,

95
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:19,200
A G F E D C B A.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,100
Now, just like we had five forms of the six string barre forms,

97
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,420
we're going to have five forms of our other, of our fifth string barre forms,

98
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,370
now lets review the six string first,

99
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,960
we have our F,

100
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,210
we learned Fm,

101
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,510
we learned F7,

102
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,170
we learned Fm7

103
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,180
and we learned Fsus.

104
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,580
Okay, one more thing,

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,810
before we dive into these fifth string barre forms,

106
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,010
let's give you a little bit more practice at jumping around on that fifth string,

107
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,240
so I'm going to say note,

108
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,410
you try and find it,

109
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,210
okay we're jumping around again.

110
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,910
What if I said C, where's the C at on that fifth string,

111
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,450
okay, right here at the third fret,

112
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,330
let's jump around a little bit, what about an F,

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,530
where would an F be, you find it,

114
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,790
counted up, C D E F,

115
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,100
what about a Bb,

116
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,260
well, that gets down to our first position,

117
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,960
we should be pretty familiar with that, Bb,

118
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,880
what about Eb,

119
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,650
counted up, A B C D E,

120
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,060
flat, right there at the sixth fret,

121
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,070
let's do a couple more,

122
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,500
Ab, where would Ab be,

123
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,030
well, there's A,

124
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,610
I can't, again I can't get any lower that way,

125
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,810
so the answer is not that way,

126
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,740
the answer is up high,

127
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,730
twelve fret, there's A, Ab, is there.

128
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,180
Okay, couple more,

129
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,210
D#,

130
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,720
D#, A B C D,

131
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,880
D# would be there.

132
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,730
Now, let's jump around on both strings for a second,

133
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,440
okay, if I want you to find a G on both strings,

134
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,840
where would it be,

135
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,080
well, here's a G here on the sixth string

136
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,290
and the G on the fifth string would be way up here,

137
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,910
if I wanted to C on both of those strings,

138
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,700
well, C on the sixth string is here,

139
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,980
C on the fifth string is there.

140
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,030
Let's do two more,

141
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,030
Eb,

142
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,360
well, Eb on the sixth string,

143
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,820
not the twelve frets, at the eleventh fret, one fret down,

144
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,230
and on the fifth string, would be at the sixth fret.

145
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,590
One more, what do you say about an F#,

146
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,040
second fret on the sixth string,

147
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,450
that what is that ninth fret on the fifth string.

148
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,530
Jumping from string to string is going to be an important concept,

149
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,390
when we start putting these forms together.

150
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,990
Now, let's talk about the five forms that are based off the fifth string,

151
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,330
okay, on the fifth string barre chords,

152
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,680
the first one I want to take a look at is Bm,

153
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,930
okay, Bm, okay,

154
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,490
that we barre,

155
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,300
again, we barre five strings with our first finger,

156
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,340
if you want to overshoot a little bit, that's fine,

157
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,770
you can bump into that six string as long as,

158
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,460
you don't play it,

159
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,860
when you're playing down here, we just get five strings.

160
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,960
Okay, so you barre all of those,

161
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,810
now I need my third finger on that fourth fret,

162
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,280
pinky underneath him

163
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,790
and that second finger on that,

164
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,290
now just just make sure that you're basing these off of the second fret,

165
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,390
because remember B is on that second fret,

166
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,490
so where F we were down here at this first fret,

167
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,290
we've pretty much done everything down to the first fret,

168
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,180
for these we shift up a little bit,

169
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,520
and the B, we're pivoting off of this B,

170
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,220
so our first finger is actually on that second fret position.

171
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,210
Okay, so there's Bm,

172
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,920
what about B7,

173
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,890
well, take my second finger off

174
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,510
and I put my pinky down on that second string,

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,400
okay, maybe do one more time,

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,570
make sure all these notes are sounding out nice and clear,

177
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
what about Bm7,

178
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,640
well, I put my second finger down and take my pinky off again,

179
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,320
got my barre down nice and strong,

180
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,310
if it sounds little buzzy on a couple of notes,

181
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,680
try and get good position on it,

182
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,280
strengthen up that first finger a little bit,

183
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,200
got Bm7.

184
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,350
Now, Bsus is the next one I want to cover,

185
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,610
that has my pinky down, like on the B7,

186
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,340
but I shift my pinky out a half step,

187
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,030
wow, so I got a pretty good stretch on that one,

188
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,410
that's a Bsus.

189
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,130
Okay, and I'm just hitting the five strings,

190
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,830
don't accidentally hit that six string,

191
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,050
accuracy counts and guitar playing,

192
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,930
you're just going for five strings,

193
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,550
make sure you get all five,

194
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,250
you gotta stretch that pinky out a little bit, get him loosened up,

195
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,920
remember we always do our finger exercise strengthen,

196
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,690
that limber up that hand a little bit,

197
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,030
if your pinky doesn't want to do that initially,

198
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,500
remember limber up in your hand takes time, just like stretching takes time,

199
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,590
if you want to start stretching with big muscles,

200
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,880
same way with little muscles,

201
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,520
even though you may not be able to get that right now,

202
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,290
that doesn't mean you're ever going to get it,

203
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,240
just means you need to limber up that hand a little bit.

204
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,970
Bsus.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Now the last one I want to cover is B,

206
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,430
now you may think that should have been the first,

207
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,350
well, there's a couple of problems with B,

208
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,000
there's two different ways you can finger it,

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,650
you'll notice the first finger down there,

210
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,120
I've got a barre all the way here

211
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,240
and then I've got second third and fourth all squished in here,

212
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,070
on that fourth fret

213
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,560
and they're all squished right underneath each other,

214
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,960
which is pretty tricky to get,

215
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,940
when you're just starting out,

216
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,180
so that's, that's the accurate way to play that,

217
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,650
that may be a little tricky for you,

218
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,110
an easier way, not quite as, as accurate way to play it,

219
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,830
but an easier way

220
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,790
and a lot of guys use it,

221
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,080
so it's nothing wrong with it,

222
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,880
is they take this B

223
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,340
and then they just barre all three of these with your third finger,

224
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,540
see that,

225
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,300
so instead of doing this,

226
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,140
they just barre that,

227
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,700
now the problem is,

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,190
is that you can't play that last string,

229
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,060
you end up with a dead string there,

230
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,470
so, or if you're sloppy you barre the whole thing

231
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,810
and you end up with the wrong chord,

232
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,120
so either gotta get off that string or don't play that last string.

233
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,080
Okay, so this way you can play all five of them,

234
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,840
with this form, you just do the inside four.

235
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,470
See how that works,

236
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,080
okay, those are basically the five forms,

237
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,800
let's go through a couple of the exercises that you have in your book.

238
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,390
Okay, let's look at some of those barre chord exercises on the fifth string,

239
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,160
using our fifth string barre forms.

240
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,820
Okay, number one, starts out with that b minor,

241
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,450
okay, here we go,

242
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,680
form it, finger nice and straight, wrist low and forward,

243
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,690
here we go, Bm,

244
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,660
ready go, two three four,

245
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,510
now you need to slide up just one half step up to Cm,

246
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,890
remember we talked about sliding,

247
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,980
don't reposition every note,

248
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,150
just let up the pressure,

249
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,830
scoot up your hand a half step,

250
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,940
now, you're a Cm,

251
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:03,660
now, we're gonna scoot up to Dm, two three,

252
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,810
one more scoop up to Em,

253
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,070
let's jump back down to Bm.

254
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
Good, see how that works,

255
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,040
if you try to reset your chord every time,

256
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,440
you'll find that that slows you way down,

257
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,980
just get practice that a little bit,

258
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,020
playing a chord, releasing it,

259
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,880
you don't need to bring your fingers off the strings,

260
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,020
just release the pressure,

261
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,780
shift your hand up to where it needs to be,

262
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,340
put the pressure back down,

263
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,480
it's a lot more efficient in your chord with that.

264
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,500
Let's look at number two,

265
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,090
starts on that Bm again,

266
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,360
ready, play,

267
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,640
now, C major, so I shift up to C,

268
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,160
and if I can squeeze all my fingers in there,

269
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,490
I get C major,

270
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,720
then I go back down to Bm,

271
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,410
now shift up to D,

272
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm gonna use that other form,

273
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,170
but have to remember, don't hit that last string.

274
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,360
Okay, let's do that one again,

275
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:25,700
Bm, C, Bm, D.

276
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,160
Good, now let's shift it up a little bit,

277
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,570
let's skip over to number five,

278
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,820
okay, let's see, number five starts on that Eb,

279
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,140
right here,

280
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,480
ready go, two three,

281
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,300
Cm7, jump down to C,

282
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,620
just continue that same rhythm

283
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:58,450
and Fm7, big jump up to the what is that fifth six seventh fret, eighth fret,

284
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,860
jump big, jump down to Bbsus, all the way at the end,

285
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,760
bring that pinky up, Bb7,

286
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,320
Eb.

287
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,740
Alright, now this time in our how music works section,

288
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,870
we're going to talk about major scales.

289
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,420
Okay, remember the major scale pattern that we talked about,

290
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,510
whole whole half, whole whole whole half,

291
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,000
two wholes and a half, three wholes and a half,

292
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,100
now you'll notice, as you did all of those

293
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,900
and hopefully you did them and did them and did them,

294
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,770
as you did,

295
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,420
all you came up with a certain combination of sharps and flats for each particular key,

296
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,370
that's what we're going to talk about now,

297
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,590
that's key signatures.

298
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,890
Now, when we talked earlier,

299
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,090
in some of the earlier sessions,

300
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,030
I just mentioned that at the beginning of a piece of music,

301
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,240
sometimes you'll see a sharp, just right after the clef sign,

302
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,380
something like that,

303
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,670
that's what that is,

304
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,630
that's a key signature,

305
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,030
now we're going to tell you why that key signature is there,

306
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,680
how that key signature is developed,

307
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,880
it's not just random,

308
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,170
that in a particular song,

309
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,690
let's say there's an F sharp in the key signature,

310
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,890
that all Fs are sharp,

311
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,280
we're going to determine that that is actually in the key of G,

312
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,330
and the key of G has one sharp in it

313
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,250
from our scales that we learned last time,

314
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,890
and that sharp is always f sharp,

315
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,250
sharps and flats come in a specific order,

316
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,620
as you're writing them in key signatures,

317
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,260
the first sharp,

318
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,310
no matter whether I have one or seven is always going to be F sharp,

319
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,670
it could think of it like a pyramid,

320
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,260
the key with one #, it would be F#,

321
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,290
then if you had two #s, it would be F# and C#,

322
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,360
and if you have three #s, it would be F#, C# and G#,

323
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,040
they build on each other like that,

324
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,020
so I wouldn't put them out of order,

325
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,000
if we start thinking of them out of order,

326
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,670
it won't make sense, when you're looking at key signatures,

327
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,590
they come in a very specific order,

328
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,630
F# first, F# C#, F# C# G# and so on, from there,

329
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,750
okay, so order is very important.

330
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,980
Now, we talked about major scales,

331
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,750
now I'm going to adjust it a little bit

332
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,690
and we're going to talk about minor scales,

333
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,900
now there's all kinds of different minor scales,

334
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,080
I play guitar for living,

335
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,120
I don't use all of those scales,

336
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,270
the only other minor scale other than a natural minor,

337
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,940
I have ever used is a harmonic minor,

338
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,640
some guys get all busy and bent out of shape

339
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,410
learning all these different minor forms,

340
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,430
you don't need to know that.

341
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,470
How I think of minor scales,

342
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,760
it's not a whole new world,

343
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,860
you relate everything back to a major scale,

344
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,740
a major scale, let's take a C major scale,

345
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,340
it goes from C, D E F G A B C, C to C,

346
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,540
to get a minor scale from that,

347
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,960
I go down, actually think of it like a number line,

348
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,020
you know it starts at C and then it just goes to C and it keeps going,

349
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,190
if I want to get a minor scale,

350
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,660
I just take that major scale

351
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,380
and I shifted down a couple of steps, two steps.

352
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,240
So, now I'm doing,

353
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,290
I'm still in the key of C,

354
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,640
no sharps or no flats,

355
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,830
but I'm starting on an A,

356
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,860
so I'm going now from A to A, not from C to C,

357
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,320
but I'm still in the key of C, no sharps or flats,

358
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,790
so I end up with A B C D E F G A,

359
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,690
that is a minor scale,

360
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,060
what we call in the business a natural minor scale,

361
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,510
okay, those are built off of the major scales,

362
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,980
there's a special relationship between that minor and the major scale,

363
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,280
it's called parallel, we hear that term floated around a lot,

364
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,300
we'll talk a lot about that,

365
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,290
things something is a parallel major or a parallel minor,

366
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,050
what that means is, if I'm in the key of C,

367
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,830
and I want to get to the minor key,

368
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,770
I can either go down too,

369
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,870
or it's probably easier for you to think of it,

370
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,850
if I go to the sixth step of a C major scale,

371
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,330
that would be A, right, C D E F G A,

372
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,770
now I'm a A,

373
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,650
A minor is the parallel major of C major,

374
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,180
and vice versa,

375
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,480
if, if I'm in C major, I want the parallel minor, it's A minor,

376
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,100
if I'm an A minor and I want the parallel major, it's C major.

377
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,600
Okay, let's do it, let's figure out another one,

378
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,520
what if I'm an F major,

379
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,640
what would be the parallel minor of F major,

380
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,190
well, I just go up to the sixth step,

381
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,140
F G A Bb C D,

382
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,760
and that would be by parallel minor,

383
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,200
see how that works,

384
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,300
now let's talk about keys a little bit.

385
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,320
Okay, we touched on keys and key signatures a little bit earlier,

386
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,660
so now let's put into work,

387
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,360
for example in the key of F,

388
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,370
when you were doing your scale,

389
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,830
you had, what was different,

390
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,150
what had a sharp or flat by,

391
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,730
you'll notice the fourth step, Bb,

392
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,470
is the only thing that had a flat or sharp in it,

393
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,550
so we would say that the key signature for the key of F has one flat, Bb.

394
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,260
Let's do another one,

395
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,510
so if the key signature has two sharps in it,

396
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,880
an F# and C#,

397
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,100
then we are in the key of D.

398
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,820
Now, let me tell you a very important trick that you can learn,

399
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,070
how to tell what key a piece of music is in,

400
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,020
there's two different ways we're going to talk about it,

401
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,980
in your first example there,

402
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,990
you'll see that the key signature has an F# in it,

403
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,080
therefore, if you go back to the scales,

404
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,160
you'll know that the only key that has one sharp in it is the key of G,

405
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,520
so you can solve it that way by by knowing your scales.

406
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,080
The second example, let's do that,

407
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,250
it has a Bb Eb and Ab,

408
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,460
well, what's scale uses a Bb Eb and Ab,

409
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,400
well, that would be the key of Eb.

410
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,910
Okay, here's another trick,

411
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,310
that's a little bit easier to learn,

412
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,560
how to tell what keys a piece of music in,

413
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,790
it has two different parts,

414
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,650
of the first part of it in sharp keys,

415
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,840
for sharp keys, the rule is,

416
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,520
how to tell a key,

417
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,370
the key is one half step up from the last sharp in the key signature,

418
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,120
I'll say that again,

419
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,950
the rule is for sharp keys,

420
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,030
the key is one half step up from the last sharp in the key signature,

421
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,930
for example, if the key signature has an F#, a C# and G#,

422
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,080
then the last sharp is a G#,

423
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,100
that's the one you're looking at,

424
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,310
one half step up from a G# is A,

425
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,740
so the key is A.

426
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,630
Okay, what about for flat keys,

427
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,310
well, here's the rule for flat keys,

428
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,640
the rule says the key is the next to last flat in the key signature,

429
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,630
so you take the key signature and derive it from there,

430
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,810
so, for example, if the key signature has a Bb Eb and an Ab in it,

431
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,930
the next to last flat is Eb,

432
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,950
that's the one you're looking at,

433
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,390
so the key is Eb.

434
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,170
Learning your major scales and the keys that come from them takes time,

435
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,120
like learning your multiplication tables,

436
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,990
we talked about that,

437
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,590
you just can't solve them one time and expect to know

438
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,450
and you've got to do them over and over and over again

439
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,250
until they get to be memorized,

440
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,610
build these scales,

441
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,290
look at the flats and sharps use,

442
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,710
look at the key signatures and take some time to memorize them.

443
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,050
Here's our assignment for this week,

444
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,800
your assignment is,

445
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,640
learn the five forms that we did on the fifth string,

446
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,550
those fifth string basic barre forms,

447
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,700
okay, we're going to learn a new song Jamaica Farewell,

448
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,260
the main name might not be familiar,

449
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,450
but I'm pretty sure that the melody will be familiar to you

450
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,480
in two different keys F and G,

451
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,580
okay, complete those key signature worksheets that we have in your book

452
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,470
and I'll see you at the workshop.

453
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,320
Okay, welcome to the workshop time,

454
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,880
let's get some working knowledge of all these concepts, that we talked about.

455
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,410
Okay, first thing we do review all of your basic barre chord forms,

456
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,880
our six string forms,

457
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,010
let's go through those, let's go through them,

458
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,870
like like we're in the key of A,

459
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:44,130
so, play an A, Am, A7, Am7, Asus,

460
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,000
okay, got those five forms.

461
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,780
Now, we're going to do the ones in on the fifth string forms, that we learned,

462
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,790
let's do those in B,

463
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,040
so we've got a B,

464
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,570
either way that you want to finger that,

465
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:09,750
we've got Bm, B7, Bm7, and Bsus.

466
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,940
We'll go through those one more time,

467
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:33,370
B, Bm, B7, Bm7 and Bsus.

468
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,980
Okay, now take a look at some of the basic barre chord exercises for the fifth string,

469
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,390
let's go through a couple of those,

470
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,100
let's start with number one,

471
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:55,570
Bm, starts it, ready go, two three four,

472
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,050
Cm, remember just slide up,

473
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,970
Dm, two three,

474
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,910
Em, two three.

475
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,840
Let's do it again,

476
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,130
Bm, jump down, two three four,

477
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,450
Cm,

478
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,420
Dm,

479
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,940
Em.

480
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,320
Number two, let's go,

481
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,160
Bm, ready, play,

482
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,190
C,

483
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,370
back to Bm,

484
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,050
repeat it.

485
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,120
Number three, ready, go,

486
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,370
try and move as fast as you can between those chords,

487
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,450
Em7,

488
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,100
C, another one,

489
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,110
two three four.

490
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,660
Take a look at number four too,

491
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,630
ready go,

492
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,920
let me stop you,

493
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,940
when you're strumming,

494
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,300
you're accurate going down remember five strings,

495
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,210
but when you come up, you just hit a couple of them,

496
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,010
okay, so you're still doing down and up,

497
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,870
but you're accurate going down,

498
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,700
[] just had a couple of them, coming up,

499
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,290
okay, armed with that information,

500
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,220
let's try number four,

501
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,140
ready, go,

502
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,240
two three four.

503
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,340
Okay, let's get down to number six,

504
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,830
okay, number six starts at a G,

505
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,150
way up at the top of your neck,

506
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,610
okay, I'm going to use the alternate forms,

507
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,240
it's probably little bit easier for me to do it

508
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,220
rather than squeezing all your fingers in like that,

509
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,660
the higher you get up the neck,

510
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,040
of course the less space you have,

511
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,330
you may need to do some of that.

512
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,320
Okay, number six, ready go,

513
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,730
down up, up,

514
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:21,770
Eb, D, Dsus,

515
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,500
back to D

516
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:33,440
and a G, two three.

517
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,880
Let's do that again, G,

518
00:28:46,850 --> 00:29:02,310
Dsus, D, G, two three four.

519
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,130
Okay, to seven, our last one here,

520
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,360
we'll pick it up a little bit,

521
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,470
starts on that Bb,

522
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:15,010
ready, go.

523
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:57,250
One more time, seven and go.

524
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,060
Now just a final, take it up a little bit faster,

525
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,260
ready, go.

526
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:20,750
Very good,

527
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,130
okay, now let's take a look at our song Jamaica Farewell,

528
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,230
okay, we're going to first do it in the key of F,

529
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,650
what is the key of F have in it, one flat,

530
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,320
okay, let's take a look at the melody first,

531
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,060
I'll play it one time through slowly

532
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,100
and then we'll do one time through fast,

533
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,080
starting it slowly, in F,

534
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,130
ready, go,

535
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:10,840
rest, rest,

536
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,940
very good, that's you do.

537
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,460
Alright, now let's play through one time fast,

538
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,140
ready, go,

539
00:31:50,130 --> 00:32:05,310
rest, rest.

540
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,230
Okay, now I'm going to play it through one time in G

541
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,910
and we'll play it at the faster tempo now,

542
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,800
that you've got a handle on it, okay,

543
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,420
ready go,

544
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:54,980
rest, rest.

545
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,700
Great, okay, now let's do the chords,

546
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,830
[] should try and use barre chords on this

547
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,600
rather than doing the open chords,

548
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,770
I know you can do the open chords,

549
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,440
let's get some barre practice on all this stuff,

550
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,100
okay, just do one chord for each barre measure at this point,

551
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,960
okay, starts on a G,

552
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,860
ready, go, two three,

553
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,190
C, now I would jump down to the fifth string and do the C there,

554
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,080
D7,

555
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,700
then back to G, down low,

556
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,130
generally I want to try to keep things low,

557
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,090
I don't want to jump to that eight fret,

558
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,040
I want to stay right that third fret,

559
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,700
because things are more comfortable down there,

560
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:58,670
one more G here, two three four,

561
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,240
C, two three four,

562
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,780
two three four,

563
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,270
two three four,

564
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,590
last line,

565
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,540
C, two three,

566
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,420
here we get G for two beats, D for two beats,

567
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,160
back to G.

568
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,860
Very good,

569
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,440
just for a second, let's talk about key signatures and keys,

570
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,740
okay, remember how parallel major and minor work,

571
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,540
in order to find a parallel minor,

572
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,940
you go down two steps from a major scale,

573
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,650
or you can go up six steps,

574
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,450
either way gets you to the same note.

575
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,060
So a C major, remember what equal an A minor,

576
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,710
F major equals D minor,

577
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,170
okay, let's practice,

578
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,320
a G major what would that be the parallel minor,

579
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,780
E minor,

580
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,460
what about G minor, what would be the parallel major there,

581
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,680
Bb major,

582
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,230
what about Eb major, what would the parallel minor be,

583
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,390
C minor,

584
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,340
what about if a key has four sharps in it,

585
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,280
they're an F# C# G# and D#,

586
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,450
what key are we in there,

587
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,080
E,

588
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,440
remember the rule, you go a half step up from the last sharp,

589
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,880
the last sharp is D#,

590
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,650
half step up from that would be an E.

591
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:29,070
Great, so my encouragement to you would be memorize those keys,

592
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,840
memorize those scales,

593
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,570
learn the fifth and sixth string barre forms,

594
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,280
be able to play them without buzzing,

595
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,150
remember it takes time to get a good sound on barre chords,

596
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,430
do all the exercises that we given to you,

597
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,020
don't just conquer them one time,

598
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,160
go back through them again,

599
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,040
strengthen those fingers up, to do what they need to do,

600
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,770
more songs are available in your book

601
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,770
and for more practice, check out the Jam Along CDs as well,

602
