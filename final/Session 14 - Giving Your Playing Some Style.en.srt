00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,440
Hi, welcome to session fourteen,

2
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,500
we're going to talk about giving your playing some style,

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,830
we're going to talk about the little nuances, that we can add to our playing,

4
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,360
that's going to give it some style,

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,560
give it some uniqueness,

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,240
become our own voice.

7
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,030
Some of those techniques are bends,

8
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,980
we're going to learn the proper technique for bending,

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,050
we're going to talk about slides,

10
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,780
talk about hammer-ons and pull-offs,

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,110
as well as palm muting with our hand,

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,220
[] going about doing octaves, like we would in Jazz work.

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,980
In our guitar tips section, we're going to talk about using a capo,

14
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,930
as well as using harmonics

15
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,460
and incorporating them into our playing.

16
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,720
So we've got a lot to do so,

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,830
let's go ahead and get started.

18
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,010
Okay, today we're gonna talk about giving your playing some style,

19
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,340
these, these are the little nuance things,

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,500
that add creative, you're your own voice to your music,

21
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,840
okay, so you don't sound like just everybody else around

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,160
and there's several different,

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,480
I just listed a few of them,

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,530
we're going to talk about them

25
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,800
and go through the proper technique form all these different things.

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,690
First thing, we're going to start off with and one of the easiest is sliding to notes,

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,960
man I was it was a long, one of the first things I've discovered,

28
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,810
that if you slide up to a note, it kind of sounds cool,

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,190
so let's practice that,

30
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,160
sliding just involves you tap whatever note you're going for,

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,350
let's say I'm going for this fifth string,

32
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,090
or fifth fret second string E,

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,890
if I want to slide up to it,

34
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,690
I just start somewhere beneath it,

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,010
let's say a half a step,

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,450
and I slide into it,

37
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,470
so I'm actually playing it on the fourth fret

38
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,110
and then I keep the pressure on this finger

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,700
and slide up to the fifth fret.

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,050
you gotta do it fairly quickly,

41
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,130
to make it work out.

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,400
Let's do exercise number one, for slides,

43
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,730
okay, without the slide, the [line] would go like this,

44
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,480
if I do the slide, turns out to be this,

45
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,180
do you hear how that slide change the sound of it,

46
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,670
do one more time, with the slide.

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,460
One of my favorite slide licks is

48
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,510
and you can do it in any key

49
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,980
I'm going to start, we're going to do it in C

50
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,610
and then I'll show it on the six string, we're going F too,

51
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,050
go into it in C,

52
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,400
and the lick starts out like this,

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,920
if I were to just play it without the slides it be C,

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,980
okay, now if I slide into that, E right here,

55
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,450
how I do that is,

56
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,000
I put my third finger on this D

57
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,660
and I slide up now to this G,

58
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,980
so let's just do the first half,

59
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,860
hear how that's gonna sound,

60
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,030
and I do the same thing,

61
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,400
putting my third finger on the G,

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,650
so I've got my hand actually in the wrong position,

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,750
then I slide up to that A

64
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,880
and hit that first finger C.

65
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,430
So let's do it together slowly,

66
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,190
[] your hand back,

67
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,690
one more time.

68
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,410
Okay, and if I was playing that in tempo would sound like this,

69
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,370
now I can actually keep going,

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,180
just take it up to take all those things up in octave,

71
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,870
if I was going down and it would be a little trickier,

72
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,060
we can only do it on the E go down to D.

73
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,190
Okay, now that's it in C,

74
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,860
if I wanted to do an f with a six string root,

75
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,150
it's pretty much the same thing,

76
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,800
we have to just the fingering just a little bit,

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,590
so an F would be like this,

78
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,400
if I want to keep going,

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,300
if I can squeeze one more out of it.

80
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,750
Okay.

81
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,650
It's a good way

82
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,900
to get a really large lick going from low to high notes

83
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,030
and you can incorporate that into any key

84
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,350
and you can go all over the neck

85
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,880
by just using that little pattern,

86
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,350
one of my favorite slide patterns.

87
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,200
Let's go to the next one, bends,

88
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,680
alright, there's some tech here's all I know about bends,

89
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,510
you want to do, you can bend a note a half step or a whole step up,

90
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,820
let's talk about the proper technique for bends too,

91
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,520
usually it's involving the third or the fourth finger.

92
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,490
Okay, so let's say I'm on this D,

93
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,500
the seventh fret with my third finger

94
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,910
and I want to bend that up,

95
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,890
okay, well, here we're going to come across another physical problem for,

96
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,490
it may take a couple of weeks for you to get a handle on physically,

97
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,310
because we've got to strengthen up these fingers,

98
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,540
I'm gonna bend using this third finger bend, this D up to an E,

99
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,990
okay, now I'm not, if I just try it,

100
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,560
you may have to bring this,

101
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,570
remember I told you never to bring your wrist up,

102
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,910
here's the one case where you can bring your wrist up,

103
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,230
get a little bit more pressure there,

104
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,940
bring that thumb over, if you need to,

105
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,410
sometimes if it's hard to bring this note all the way up,

106
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,700
use these other two fingers behind him to help bring that string up,

107
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,410
so you put them all three of them down

108
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,210
and now bend that note up.

109
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,310
That's using our third finger,

110
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,670
if I wanted to do one that would be using my fourth finger,

111
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,680
maybe I could go this G here

112
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,850
and I could bend him up,

113
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,500
now I can bend up just a half step,

114
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,910
let's go back to my D,

115
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,300
half step up would be Eb, that's that note,

116
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:14,130
or I can do a whole note, a whole step,

117
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,950
that would be a whole step, half step,

118
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,500
now one of the secrets to bending

119
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,910
and I learned this from Larry Carlton,

120
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,130
one of the greatest guitar players,

121
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,780
that incorporates this style,

122
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,700
he said, that when you bend,

123
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,560
bend up to a pitch, don't just bend up somewhere,

124
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,240
which is what a lot of guitar players do

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,200
and they're playing a solo

126
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,970
and they just kind of bend around and bend up,

127
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,070
it's kind of a lazy man's way of doing it,

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,680
when you're gonna bend, bend to a pitch,

129
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,750
either a half step up or a whole step up,

130
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,430
okay, takes a little bit of a trick,

131
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,440
a little bit of control do that,

132
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,310
and that's the whole issue,

133
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,430
control, don't just kind of bend somewhere, bend to a pitch.

134
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,740
Okay, so we've talked about half step bends,

135
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,210
we've talked about whole step bends,

136
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,720
now let's incorporate those into our pentatonic scale.

137
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,140
Okay, so here's our A minor pentatonic,

138
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,570
first form here that we've used some often,

139
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,340
what notes are good to bend in that,

140
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,130
well, you don't want to bend on these low notes,

141
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,520
it just gets a little bit, just too low doesn't sound real good,

142
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,960
here's the first one that starts being good to bend,

143
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,940
I can bend this one a half step,

144
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,370
which would get me to the []

145
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,470
or I can bend up a whole step,

146
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,300
which would get me to the whole a [] [],

147
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:43,080
okay, so that note is good to bend,

148
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,420
either half step or whole step,

149
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,750
this G, I can bend it up a whole step and it sounds great,

150
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,930
okay, I don't want to bend up just a half step,

151
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,300
that doesn't sound too good to get out of the key,

152
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,290
note also that I can bend is this pinky right here,

153
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,190
now you got to kind of play with your fingers on that string,

154
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,440
what do you do with your fingernails

155
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,930
and where does the actual strings that you're coming into,

156
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,190
where do they go,

157
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,130
do they go, if you can,

158
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,260
if you get your fingernails down close enough to the fret board,

159
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,270
you can push those other strings up,

160
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,160
actually over your nail,

161
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,890
and that's one way to do it,

162
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,740
if you've got, if you go out completely another direction

163
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,060
and go at a real flat,

164
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,540
you just push all those other strings up underneath,

165
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,920
there's two ways you need to do it,

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
you need to figure out which way works best for you,

167
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,980
okay so that notes that we can bend a pentatonic scale

168
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,180
are this one, this one and this one

169
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,460
in that first pentatonic form.

170
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,340
Okay, the other forms would have different notes that those can bend too,

171
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,350
but they would be the same equivalent pitches,

172
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,880
the D G and the and C, are the ones that we can use,

173
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,480
one of the best exercises, you can use to strengthen your hand

174
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,800
and all these bends involve strengthening your hands, strengthening these fingers,

175
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,970
you don't get it the first time,

176
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,950
some of you might, if you have strong hands,

177
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,110
but the other ones will have to work on a little bit

178
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,440
has to do with string, how thick your strings are,

179
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,140
how strong your hand is, that sort of stuff,

180
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,740
a great exercise that Larry Carlton uses is

181
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,570
doing a major scale with bends,

182
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm going to play through solely

183
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,810
and then we'll talk about him,

184
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,120
C D and then we bend up to this E,

185
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,170
then I have to stick my first finger up here that F, G bend up to the A,

186
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,560
we're going to pitch, B C,

187
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,250
I did it again, C D E,

188
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,670
putting in a major scale format is really easy to hear,

189
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,720
when you're not quite at it,

190
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,880
okay, going down, it's a little bit different

191
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,100
here your first finger is here, C

192
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,280
and I'm gonna bend up to this B from this A,

193
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,250
can bend up from this D,

194
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,480
so let's go down one more time,

195
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,790
C, then from the A to the B,

196
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,260
A G F, bend up to the E,

197
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,920
D C,

198
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,150
if I put it in context,

199
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:39,530
it would be a good exercise to get your hands strong enough,

200
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,670
to do the bends that you need

201
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,170
and incorporate those into your play.

202
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,140
Next thing we want to talk about is hammer-ons,

203
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,520
okay, what's a hammer-on,

204
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,510
well, it's not a shark,

205
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,460
what a hammer-on, that's a hammerhead,

206
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,030
hammer-on is, if I'm using that same form,

207
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,380
I'm going to take my,

208
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,850
let's say I'm starting on this E,

209
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,320
and I'm going to hammer-on to this G,

210
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,410
what is involved practically is,

211
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,810
I'm just going to take this pinky G

212
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,680
and whack my pinky down as hard as I can,

213
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,240
I'm not gonna, I only play the E,

214
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,650
I don't pick the G,

215
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,210
I just force my pinky down so strong,

216
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,400
that it actually sounds out the G,

217
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,010
think of it like a hammer-on a piano,

218
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,330
if you ever looked inside a piano,

219
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,030
there's a hammer that's actually hitting those strings,

220
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,530
and that's what you're G fingers doing,

221
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,110
if I do it on A to a C.

222
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,450
Okay, now I can do this,

223
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,860
with first to second finger, first to third finger, first to fourth finger.

224
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,590
So let's look at our hammer-on exercise,

225
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
the first one goes from like E to F,

226
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,150
trying to get that second note to sound out,

227
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,140
keep that pressure on you,

228
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,510
really have to whack it against that fret board,

229
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,270
let's go from E F# or one to three,

230
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,270
what about E to G, one to four.

231
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,070
Okay, try it on different strings,

232
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,340
try it on different places on the fret board,

233
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,320
takes a little bit of muscle in that pinky

234
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,030
to get to hammer-on strong enough,

235
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,080
but that's what you're going for,

236
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,780
you want both notes to actually sound pretty similar.

237
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,900
Now let's talk about the flip side of hammer-ons, which is pull-offs,

238
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,980
pull-offs,

239
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,870
let's say I'm going from this G

240
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,340
and I want to get back to this E

241
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,870
without picking the note,

242
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,580
instead of picking it like that,

243
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,040
I have my finger on this G

244
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,780
and I'm gonna pull down,

245
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,210
I got a lot of pressure on this E

246
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,930
and I pull down and release that string.

247
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,580
So I'm doing two things,

248
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,710
not only am I pulling down with this string,

249
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,860
I'm also giving counter pressure with this finger,

250
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,540
not only I'm pulling down with this finger,

251
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,430
but I'm giving counter pressure with this finger,

252
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,530
so one finger's going down, one finger's going up,

253
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,170
I do with my third finger,

254
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,500
practice it with your second finger, third finger, fourth finger,

255
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:46,010
now I can combine those with a hammer-on,

256
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,640
I hammer-on one way and then pull-off the other,

257
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,020
I'm only actually hitting one note with my pick

258
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,510
and the rest of it, my fingers are doing.

259
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:10,700
Okay, so incorporating hammer-ons and pull-offs into your playing,

260
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,780
now hammer-on,

261
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,610
let's talk about one specific technique,

262
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,240
that we need to work on with a hammer-ons and pull-offs，

263
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,110
that would be the Eddie Van Halen type of tapping,

264
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,790
okay, bunch of different skills involved with this one,

265
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,090
let me do it without distortion first,

266
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,230
then I'll do it with distortion,

267
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,720
let's say I'm going between this E and this G,

268
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,670
and I'm also gonna come over here with my first finger and hit this A,

269
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,390
so I got three things going, I got the E, G, A,

270
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,700
now, I'm not Eddie Van Halen,

271
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,340
but basically here's the deal on that concept,

272
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,730
you kind of starts the note,

273
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,660
pull-off,

274
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,860
with this finger, I'm actually kind of tugging down a little bit of,

275
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,840
I'm kind of doing pull-off with my other finger,

276
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:10,570
okay, that's basically it,

277
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,640
now gets infinitely more complex than that,

278
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,520
but that's basically the technique that's being used,

279
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,600
throw a little distortion, little delay, crank it up,

280
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:30,550
sound rock and roll with it,

281
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,170
that's basically what that technique is.

282
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,750
Now, another thing,

283
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,380
if I want to incorporate hammer-ons and pull-offs into my pentatonic scale,

284
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,480
well, I can go something like this,

285
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:51,060
I'm actually hitting the first one of each pair,

286
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,730
sometimes hammer-ons and pull-offs are a great way to get a lot of speed

287
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:10,050
without actually having to pick it all,

288
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,010
sounds really impressive,

289
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,600
sounds like I'm going really fast,

290
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,590
actually I'm, I guess my fingers on this hand are doing all the work,

291
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,580
but not this hand,

292
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,980
I'm using all hammer-ons and pull-offs,

293
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,160
so practice doing scales practice, doing our pentatonic scales

294
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,550
with those and hammer-on, hammering-on and pulling them off.

295
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,090
Okay, okay, the next thing I want to talk about is muting with our palm,

296
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,350
very common technique,

297
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:40,030
I did a little bit, when we, when we had our welcome part little bit earlier,

298
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,970
and that was the thing that I did, using palm muting,

299
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,020
I'm taking this part of the fleshy part of my palm on my right hand,

300
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,800
putting it right at the bridge down here,

301
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,580
and then I'm playing a note,

302
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,710
let's say I'm playing an A here, at the seventh fret,

303
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,930
okay, now if I put it too far back,

304
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,000
it just sounds like a regular string,

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,260
but put it too far up,

306
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,630
it kind of gets this funny sounds,

307
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,170
it takes a little while to figure out getting just the sweet spot,

308
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,460
where you can hear where it's supposed to be,

309
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,490
I can do my major pentatonic minor pentatonic, excuse me,

310
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,230
it lends itself a little bit easier doing all down strokes rather than down and up,

311
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,420
it's hard to do,

312
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,470
I guess you can do ups,

313
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,230
but it lends itself a bit better doing down strokes on that,

314
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,350
so I'm practicing, practice on that,

315
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,610
you get this hand straight,

316
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:44,200
put it on that bridge, a little bit up from bridge.

317
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,240
Okay, now if I'm in let's say Am, Am chord,

318
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,290
remember our triads is built up of an A C and E,

319
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,650
okay, if I'm in Am7 be A C E and G,

320
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,030
now I can take,

321
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,310
I don't want to play an Am7 the whole time,

322
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:09,600
if I want to have a [],

323
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,290
well that's not very interesting, if I'm doing a rhythm accompaniment with it,

324
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,350
so a lot of times, I can just take certain notes of that chord,

325
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,000
do a little palm muting with it

326
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,700
and I end up making some music with it.

327
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,860
Okay, take a listen to [] here,

328
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,250
I'm just using the A,

329
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm using G and A,

330
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,100
then I throw the C and E in there too,

331
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,050
one of the most helpful techniques I've ever learned is that palm muting,

332
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,440
folks, some folks will put up a song,

333
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't know whether, I don't know anything,

334
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,680
what the chord changes are anything,

335
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,180
I'm supposed to play something fabulous,

336
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,220
you just take whatever key you're in,

337
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,620
I play the root of that key

338
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,340
and I've got it,

339
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,420
let's say, in C,

340
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,180
I don't know what the chord changes are,

341
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,960
I don't know anything,

342
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,910
I just I just vamp on that C

343
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,550
and it sounds hip,

344
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:45,240
through a couple notes around it,

345
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,100
and yeah you can still work,

346
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,310
you've got a good funky guitar part that you can play,

347
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,020
you're not just hammering out the chords

348
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,520
which is what every other guitar player would do,

349
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,540
you've got something unique

350
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,620
and all of this is you're just taking the root of the chord or the fifth sometimes,

351
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,940
do a little palm muting,

352
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,350
come up with a little rhythm with it

353
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,610
and that's all that is.

354
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,830
Okay, another technique I want to show you is

355
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:11,650
picking, while you're picking, putting my second finger the nail, just down on the string,

356
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,960
just setting it on the string, while I'm playing,

357
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,240
it gets this little bit of a harmonic happening

358
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,760
and it's real, real cool, real common sound,

359
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,610
so if I'm playing, let's say a C major scale,

360
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,570
now I'm just gonna set my second finger nail on top of those strings as,

361
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,810
you hear how it doesn't come out perfect all the time,

362
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:44,680
but sometimes it gets a [] harmonic way at top,

363
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:57,850
okay, throw a little distortion on that,

364
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,890
hear that harmonic way up there,

365
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,240
that's all coming from using that second finger nail on that,

366
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,250
it takes a little practice to get it down,

367
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:09,970
but once you get it,

368
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,280
it's a real [] effect,

369
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,540
that you can put into your playing.

370
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,120
Last thing I want to talk about is octaves,

371
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,670
let's say I'm playing, a guy puts up a song

372
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,920
and I'm supposed to sound jazzy,

373
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,950
okay, well I can play in octaves,

374
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,020
now octaves in our music notation,

375
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,770
if I'm playing a C,

376
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,820
that would be a low C and a high C, play at the same time,

377
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,480
okay, how it fingers well best,

378
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,790
how it fingers best on guitar,

379
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,410
so if I use one and three,

380
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,490
now, how do I play those,

381
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,750
because I've got a string in between,

382
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,180
without getting that string to sound,

383
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,430
well, actually got my, I play it kind of sloppy

384
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,480
and I put my first finger down on that middle string,

385
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,550
so actually what you're hearing is,

386
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,280
you're hearing that dead string in between them,

387
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,900
when I play it all together,

388
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,630
but it doesn't come out,

389
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,270
I can do it on the six string,

390
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,110
I can use one four perhaps,

391
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,820
one four,

392
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:19,760
okay, when I go down to the next set of strings, the fourth and second,

393
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,750
I've got to open up, use only one four,

394
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,460
because that's how the guitar is tuned,

395
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,630
you end up with a wider stretch,

396
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:35,050
same thing for the next string,

397
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,240
octaves takes a little bit practicing to get it,

398
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:45,310
what you get, if I want to sound jazzy,

399
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,230
I just do octaves like that,

400
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,630
now there's a great jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery,

401
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,630
he didn't use a pick, he used his thumb for these octaves,

402
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,040
gets even a sweeter sound,

403
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:08,920
you can see how [] sound gets,

404
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:17,320
okay, now if I want to fake that sound,

405
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,440
sometimes I can just flick my third finger instead of picking,

406
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,790
I'm using my third finger

407
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:29,440
and just kind of whacking the back of my third finger there,

408
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,300
Jazz octaves.

409
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,120
Okay, now let's take a look at some more techniques,

410
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,350
that use your guitar and your instrument for actually creating some different techniques.

411
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,350
Okay, now we're gonna talk about using our guitar instrument

412
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,600
and we're giving some different techniques out of that,

413
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,550
first thing to talk about is using a capo,

414
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,530
now here's a capo,

415
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,410
what, what is involved in a little metal thing,

416
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,080
probably cost you four or five bucks down at the music store,

417
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,060
okay, pretty strong

418
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,160
and you put it over the neck of your guitar,

419
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,460
like I could put the third fret.

420
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,790
Now what's the capo used for,

421
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,110
well, here's a couple things,

422
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,460
the first thing, it's used for,

423
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,920
if I want to just do simple chord progressions

424
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,440
and I only know G Cs and Ds

425
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,300
and I only know open chords,

426
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,720
but I want to be able to use my open chords in a song,

427
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,380
that does not is not an open chord key like G C or D,

428
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,860
let's say the song is in Eb or something different like that,

429
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,230
well, no problem,

430
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:45,290
you find, let's say the chords are D G and A,

431
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,140
but they want to do it,

432
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,660
they want to take it up the key and do it in Eb,

433
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,160
well, no problem,

434
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,820
the distance between d and Eb,

435
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,300
the key that I know my chords in and Eb where we're going is one half step,

436
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,890
which is one frets worth on the guitar,

437
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,950
so I put my capo at the first fret

438
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:13,010
and now I've got my D chord, G chord, A chord,

439
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,440
but now I can play it in a different key,

440
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,940
so I'm playing a D,

441
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:25,460
but it's actually sounding as an Eb,

442
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,060
see that change the sound of a guitar,

443
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,290
I can go even more than that,

444
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,500
let's say I wanted to do my D chord,

445
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,180
but we're going to use it in the key of G,

446
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,590
well, the distance for [] D and a G is a fourth,

447
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,330
well, that is five frets worth on a guitar,

448
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,720
so I would have to put it at,

449
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,210
let's see what, the sixth fret, sixth fret [], sixth frets [],

450
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:10,260
sorry, I was right, the first time, fifth fret.

451
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,850
Capos were great,

452
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,950
but after I get out too far,

453
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,300
it's kind of hard for,

454
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,950
it's just too hard and too small for fingers to get in there,

455
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,990
so they work best down here,

456
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,480
now you see the mental calculations I had to go through

457
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,550
in order to find out where to place the capo,

458
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,450
what's involved is

459
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,920
you take the key that you're doing the chords in D G C whatever

460
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,050
and the key that you're going to,

461
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,970
you want to use those chords in,

462
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,130
let's say I wanted to use the Eb,

463
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,620
okay, and I'm starting on a D,

464
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,690
I count up one, the distance between D and Eb is one half step,

465
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,460
which is one frets worth on the guitar,

466
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,710
so I put it at the first fret,

467
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,270
If I were going from D to F,

468
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,740
you have to count half steps,

469
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,200
D to Eb, Eb to E, E to F,

470
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,490
that's three steps,

471
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,030
so I would put it at the third fret, one two three.

472
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:12,910
Okay, then I wanna talk about is harmonics,

473
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,200
well, what are harmonics,

474
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,850
well, there's a couple of things,

475
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,650
when I play stuff like,

476
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,510
sorry.

477
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,310
This is a string,

478
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,070
the exact midway point of that string is at the twelfth fret,

479
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,120
if I just barely touch that twelfth fret,

480
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,670
not fret it, just barely touch exactly over the fret,

481
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,300
not behind the fret, like we have been doing, when we've actually figured that,

482
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,720
if I just barely touched over the fret,

483
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,110
can get this bell like sound,

484
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,090
which is the exact midway point of the string

485
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,710
in physical sciences called a node, in music, it's called a harmonic.

486
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,600
There's one at the twelfth fret,

487
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,860
now it doesn't work,

488
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,350
if I'm at the eleventh fret, doesn't work,

489
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,690
thirteen fret, doesn't work,

490
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,170
it's very precise, twelve fret, where you get them.

491
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,930
I can also get at the seventh fret,

492
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,200
I can also get at the fifth fret,

493
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,220
after that it gets pretty hard to get them.

494
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,830
So the ones that you mainly use this one is the strongest,

495
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,990
this is the next strongest,

496
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,710
this one is the next strongest, next weak, excuse me.

497
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,900
Sometimes I can incorporate that into my playing,

498
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,420
if I'm playing let's see a G chord,

499
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:46,490
that has open D, open G, open B,

500
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,870
I can hit that right there,

501
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,160
that would be a D triad,

502
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,170
that would be a G triad,

503
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,270
that harmonics at work.

504
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,920
I also with a little bit of effort

505
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,680
can do what's called false harmonics,

506
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,110
okay, so let's say I do a barre chord,

507
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,270
well, if I just play an octave up from each of these strings,

508
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,710
I can get another harmonic,

509
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,230
with using my first finger,

510
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,150
I'm gonna pluck with my thumb,

511
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,380
and barely touch the string with my first finger

512
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,560
exactly an octave up from where I'm fingering,

513
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,120
so if my barre is here,

514
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,580
on this F,

515
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,650
then I go up to this F here,

516
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,510
barely touch it and pluck it

517
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,340
and I get the harmonic,

518
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,150
then, if I just kind of outline the chord,

519
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,040
C F A C F,

520
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,110
I have to kind of outline the chord,

521
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,960
I can get some false harmonics here,

522
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,250
I can do melodies with them,

523
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:59,560
I think if I play.

524
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:07,200
Okay, if I wanted to do let's say a little scale,

525
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,270
okay, I'm doing this false harmonic,

526
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,870
I'm pulling off this note right there.

527
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:30,390
So I'm combining a whole bunch of different things,

528
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,890
you just have to be real accurate where those harmonics are at,

529
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,370
anyway, those are some different techniques that you can use,

530
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,980
when playing to throw some little spice into your playing.

531
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,340
Let's talk about our assignment for this this week,

532
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,310
your assignment for this session is

533
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,130
I want you to practice the bending exercises that we have in your book,

534
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,190
practice bending controlled into a pitch,

535
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,690
remember Larry Carlton's thing,

536
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,210
we don't just bend up, we bend to a pitch,

537
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,190
use that major scale exercise

538
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,750
to help you get some strength in your hand

539
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,250
to do those bends on that major scale.

540
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,660
Next thing in what you do is the slide riff exercise, that we talked about,

541
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,280
do it on the sixth string,

542
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,810
okay, on the fifth string,

543
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,010
practicing in different keys and different places on the neck,

544
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,770
you can incorporate that into your toolkit of playing,

545
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,140
okay, whip those out, when you need to do a solo.

546
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:28,340
Practice doing your pentatonic scales

547
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,930
using the palm muting that we talked about,

548
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,310
[] for a good clear tone,

549
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,580
also work on those jazz octaves,

550
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:44,180
I give up my pick, my thumb,

551
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,220
back my third finger, slides,

552
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,530
all these little things make your playing interesting and unique.

553
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:00,390
So, we'll go ahead and see you next time.

554
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,980
Okay, first thing we're gonna do in our workshop today is bends,

555
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,830
remember our good proper technique for bends,

556
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,150
if I want to bend up,

557
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,610
I can use these other fingers behind this,

558
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,580
third finger, fourth finger to help that string get up.

559
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,350
Okay, in order to strengthen that finger,

560
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,940
we're going to do a simple exercise,

561
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,930
we're going to go from the D to an E, bend up to an Eb, just a half step.

562
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,510
Okay, nice and slow, ready go,

563
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,360
D Eb,

564
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,970
D Eb,

565
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,680
D Eb,

566
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,110
D Eb.

567
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,360
Now let's go up to a D to an E,

568
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,500
we're gonna bend it up a whole step,

569
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,050
D E,

570
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,580
D E,

571
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,020
D E,

572
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,650
D E.

573
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,440
Now let's do it with our fourth finger,

574
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,730
so let's go to this G here,

575
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,730
we're going to take him up a half step and then a whole step,

576
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,080
half step first,

577
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,360
ready go, G,

578
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:19,940
let's do a whole step,

579
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,160
remember your pitch that you're going for.

580
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,690
Okay, practice those in different keys and different places on the neck,

581
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,340
let's do another place,

582
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,760
let's do it, let's begin from this G,

583
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,680
up to a half step and then a whole step up to A,

584
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,320
so we go to to an Ab first

585
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,780
or this F, go F to F#,

586
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,210
ready, go,

587
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,780
whole step, F to G.

588
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,550
Remember a major scale exercise, C D E F G A B C,

589
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,330
let's practice it,

590
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,710
ready go,

591
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,600
C D up to E,

592
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,050
let's go back down,

593
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,970
C and after the B,

594
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:44,350
A G F E D C,

595
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,250
do it again.

596
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:08,690
Do it in another place,

597
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,680
let's do it on F,

598
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,830
okay, here's an F, ready, go,

599
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,110
don't let yourself be sloppy with all this,

600
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,290
do quarter notes.

601
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:48,250
Great, let's talk about hammer-ons and pull-offs,

602
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,730
remember good technique for those when you're hammer-on these notes,

603
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,470
really whack that fourth finger, third finger, second finger,

604
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,000
you've got to hit it hard on there,

605
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,890
so this first finger has to be stable

606
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,920
and then you're really hitting that second finger down,

607
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,110
let's do some hammer-on exercises.

608
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,650
Okay, we're gonna go, from the, on the fifth position, fifth fret,

609
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,270
we go for our first or second finger,

610
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,180
practice that first.

611
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,080
Let's practice going from one to three,

612
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,480
let's go for maybe the C to the D here,

613
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,950
ready, go,

614
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,270
good clear notes,

615
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,680
let's go from one to four,

616
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
maybe from this A to the C,

617
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,160
really hold it hard.

618
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,790
Great, now let's do some pull-off exercises,

619
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,770
we're gonna go from four to three,

620
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,000
four to two, four to one.

621
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,410
Okay, starting on this C,

622
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,570
pinky, reddy go,

623
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,790
then,

624
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,370
one more time,

625
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,920
once again,

626
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,820
a little bit faster.

627
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,250
Great, okay, now let's talk over the tapping exercise,

628
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,260
we're starting to E, gonna hammer up to this G,

629
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:02,460
do a little hammer-on pull-off there,

630
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,890
then we come up with our first finger hit this A,

631
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,920
and pull-off to that E,

632
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,020
see how that works,

633
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,890
so going slow a little bit.

634
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,650
Okay, let's try one more time,

635
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,430
ready, go,

636
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,200
now let's put a bunch of them together in a row,

637
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,570
keep that first finger nice and steady,

638
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:55,260
let's speed it up a bit,

639
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,580
see how that works.

640
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,450
Okay, next thing we want to cover is our palm muting exercise,

641
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,500
remember good technique,

642
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,420
for this bring that wrist back,

643
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:07,560
so gently set that palm on top of your bridge,

644
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,020
a little bit forward, a little bit in front of it,

645
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,940
takes a while to get the sweet spot on it,

646
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,980
let's do A minor pentatonic,

647
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,750
first form using this palm muting technique,

648
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,160
ready, go,

649
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,400
let's go back down,

650
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:33,470
good strong picking, when you do it,

651
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,940
let's go up to the second form,

652
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,230
we haven't done much for the second form,

653
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,370
let's do the same thing in the second form,

654
00:40:50,480 --> 00:41:02,120
third form.

655
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:07,620
Good, now let's play our A minor [] example for you

656
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,060
and you try and incorporate some of that palm muting technique,

657
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,290
like Paul Jackson Jr,

658
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,800
Paul Jackson Jr, the great guitar players that uses this technique,

659
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,760
try and just do a single couple of notes out of the key

660
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,190
and see if you can make up a rhythm that works out nicely.

661
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,690
Okay, so let's fire it up,

662
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,850
you don't need do I'm doing, find your own,

663
00:41:50,810 --> 00:42:05,870
I'm doing G A, G A, G A, G A.

664
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,830
Great, we're gonna play that example one more time,

665
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,270
this time I want you to use

666
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,330
some of the Jazz octaves, that we had talked about,

667
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,950
really anything you can play,

668
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,500
anything in a C major scale in octaves

669
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,490
and it's gonna work,

670
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,600
let's practice,

671
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,170
you try different rhythms.

672
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,680
Great, lot of these techniques add so much to your playing,

673
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,130
so you want to try and use them as much as you can,

674
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,740
play a unique style and a unique voice,

675
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,570
keep working at these things,

676
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,500
remember winners do what losers are unwilling to do,

677
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:27,160
so you're putting forth the effort to better yourself

678
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,330
and better your guitar playing

679
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,640
and it's gonna pay off in years to come,

680
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,600
when you're playing,

681
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,650
we'll see later.
