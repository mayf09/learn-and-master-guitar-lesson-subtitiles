00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,780
Hi, welcome to session 18,

2
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,610
in this session, we're gonna talk about Jazz,

3
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,810
one of my favorite subjects,

4
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,780
how to play Jazz,

5
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,970
how to incorporate Jazz into your playing,

6
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,730
how to get that warm round Jazz tone,

7
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,595
we're also gonna talk about chord melodies, chord melody soloing,

8
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,730
I did a little bit of that in the intro there,

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,305
it's taking a melody and adding chords underneath it

10
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:01,470
to make a more impacting solo,

11
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,700
talking about Jazzing up your chord progressions

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,730
or regular chord progressions using chord tones,

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,935
and we also learn some popular Jazz forms,

14
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,900
like your major seventh chords, your minor seventh chords and your ninth forms.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,860
In the how music works section,

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,010
we're gonna learn about ninth what they are,

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,650
in music in, in understanding music,

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,950
what are ninth, what are eleventh, what are thirteenth.

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,505
What a great topic,

20
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:25,435
we're gonna have a lot of fun today,

21
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:26,310
let's go ahead and get started.

22
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,045
Okay, Jazz guitar playing is such a great and creative way

23
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:45,280
to add dimension into your playing,

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,190
so many different things can happen with Jazz

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,340
in harmonically with what's going on with the music,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,360
rather than going just beyond the normal C G and D, that everybody plays,

27
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,900
you throw in some jazz chords,

28
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,510
it really adds some dimension you're playing.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,785
Now let's talk about some Jazz guitars,

30
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,670
I'm playing on a Gibson ES335 right here,

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,370
very common in guitar,

32
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,540
you can do a lot of different styles

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,030
and it works real good for Jazz,

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,980
it's got these humbucker pickups,

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,340
which work real good for Jazz,

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,380
there's also an ES175,

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,540
which is a thicker model

38
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,570
and that gets a little bit more of a rounder Jazz tone.

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,050
Okay, let's talk about tone for a minute,

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,310
what makes a good Jazz sound for guitars,

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,680
well, you don't want anything too bright,

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,170
so generally,

43
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:28,905
the first thing I do,

44
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:29,840
if I want to play Jazz,

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,140
as I go down to the amp

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,990
and I crank up the base a little bit,

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,910
I usually bring back, roll off some of those highs a little bit as well,

48
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,170
get a little bit more of a warmer, fatter tone.

49
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,610
Sometimes I'll go over here to my tone knob

50
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,300
and I roll the tone back a little bit as well,

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,750
that helps in taking a little bit of that edge off the sound,

52
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,625
that's part of getting that Jazz tone,

53
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,005
it's just taking that edge off the sound,

54
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:54,940
you don't want it harsh,

55
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,770
as harsh as it is in rock playing.

56
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,650
Okay, so that's, that's some secrets to getting a good Jazz tone.

57
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,425
Also, the type of pick is helpful on that,

58
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:08,120
you want something that's kind of fatter and rounder than a normal pick,

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,300
it's a little bit thicker,

60
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,510
its you at least a heavy pick,

61
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,110
when you do Jazz stuff,

62
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,200
I have, I have another one here that I use a lot as well,

63
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,810
you see, it almost has no point on it at all,

64
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,650
it's just such a round thick

65
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,380
and that's what you need guitar, for Jazz guitar playing.

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,765
Okay, now let's talk about chord melodies,

67
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:35,070
this is one thing that they use a lot in Jazz chord playing,

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,395
okay, what do I mean by chord melodies,

69
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:39,390
well, here's the idea,

70
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,830
you have your melody,

71
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,370
your single note melody up on top,

72
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,060
and then I'm going to try and squeeze in all of the chord tones

73
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,270
for the appropriate chords underneath that chord melody.

74
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,100
Let's look at that first example in your book,

75
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,350
the regular melody goes like this.

76
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,760
Okay, that would be a good Jazz little lick there,

77
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,890
now if I want to put chords underneath it,

78
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,025
I kind of go something like this,

79
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:05,960
ready go,

80
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,535
now I just added a Cmaj7,

81
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:14,280
we're gonna talk about those forms here in a second,

82
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,640
but I added a Cmaj7 and an Emaj7 underneath it

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,500
to kind of give it a little bit of texture underneath,

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,850
it makes a little bit more creative.

85
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,500
Let's look at that second example,

86
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,580
okay, just the normal melody is like this,

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
ready, go,

88
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,880
okay, so now throw some chords on it,

89
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,680
comes out to be,

90
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,940
see how that works,

91
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,890
you just want to make sure you're adding chords to the notes

92
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,670
and where they appropriately come in the song,

93
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,020
and sometimes you have to kind of play around with the fingering of your chord,

94
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,300
if your chord like the Cmaj7 usually goes down to this G,

95
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,760
but I just needed it down to the E,

96
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,585
so I just use it where I need it,

97
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:58,500
I just go down the E,

98
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,810
I don't go all the way through the chord.

99
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,510
Another thing they do a lot in jazz is they do,

100
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,480
West Montgomery was the Jazz guitar player that started,

101
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,680
they do octaves,

102
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:14,095
okay, so I just like here,

103
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,530
I am at the C at the eighth fret and the fifth fret,

104
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,600
I use my first and my pinky there,

105
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,220
and I can play with my pick,

106
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,490
and again, I'm deadening that inner string there,

107
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,430
but when I go down to the fifth and the third string,

108
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,440
I've got to go back to one and three

109
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,700
and same thing with the sixth and the fourth,

110
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,040
I gotta go one and three as well,

111
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,350
I can use it with a pick

112
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,730
or I can use it with just my thumb,

113
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,100
that's how West Montgomery did it,

114
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,955
okay, so that's how West Montgomery did it.

115
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,180
Let me do those chord melodies that we did it earlier,

116
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,005
this time I'm going to use octaves with it,

117
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:01,300
see how it changes the sound.

118
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,520
Okay, so let's do the first example again,

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,730
next example,

120
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,655
takes a little practice to get the feel of using those octaves,

121
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:17,165
but once you do,

122
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:19,360
it's a real neat effect, that you can add into your playing.

123
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,920
Okay, let me just touch on a couple of very common Jazz chord forms,

124
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,480
that we haven't yet hit,

125
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,140
we've hit a bunch of open chords,

126
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,330
we've hit some barre chords,

127
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,240
now let's get on some of these Jazz chords,

128
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,120
that involve a little bit more complex harmony,

129
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,020
your major sevenths, your minor sevenths, some ninth chords,

130
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,505
we'll talk more about what's involved in those ninth chords

131
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:40,220
in our how music works section here in a second.

132
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,990
But let me just show you some of those forms,

133
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,100
in Jazz, you generally don't want to have open strings,

134
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,195
you wanna have movable chords,

135
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:49,440
they don't always have to be barre chords,

136
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,800
but they do have to be movable chords,

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,980
it, it just doesn't get that Jazz sound when you have open strings.

138
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,250
Okay, so let's look at some of those main, major seventh forms first,

139
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,820
on the sixth string, the form that I use all the time is this for an Fmaj7,

140
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,360
again, you're muting that fifth string

141
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,710
and I don't play that highest six, first string, excuse me,

142
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,570
now if I wanted one based off of a fifth string,

143
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,790
I've got this very common Bmaj7 form right there,

144
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,770
I use it all the time,

145
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,610
anytime you're playing Jazz,

146
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,160
that's one of my key chords,

147
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,470
another one is switch my fingers around a little bit

148
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,225
and I have a Bmaj7 there,

149
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:37,870
remember that diamond is the pivot note of those movable chords,

150
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,910
so I can move it up to here to Cmaj7 Dmaj7,

151
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,670
okay, look at that,

152
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,600
that next form a Dmaj7 still based off the fifth string,

153
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,700
this time I'm pivoting off of that pinky though,

154
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,530
okay, major, seventh chord.

155
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,090
Okay, now there's a couple of them,

156
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,040
couple of them that you can base off of the fourth string as well,

157
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,230
which I use that quite a bit,

158
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,730
this would be like an Emaj7,

159
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,420
you got barre all three strings here with your third finger.

160
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,140
Okay, next one is a Gmaj7,

161
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,130
where is the G in this Gmaj7, right there,

162
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,950
and you end up having the seventh pitch up at the top.

163
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,640
Okay, so those are what, six different major seventh forms,

164
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,360
that's just about all the major seventh forms that I ever use,

165
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,950
is in those six forms,

166
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,625
so get those underneath your fingers

167
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,490
and you'll be able to go a long way in playing Jazz,

168
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,790
because they use an awful lot of major seventh chords.

169
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,650
Let's take look at, take a look at the next batch, some minor seventh chords,

170
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,685
now, we've already found a couple of those,

171
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:43,290
when we were back doing our barre chords,

172
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,730
way back in the earlier sessions, probably session seven or so.

173
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,295
Okay, so we're going to talk about some different forms that are minor seven forms,

174
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,950
let me just go through them real quick,

175
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,910
we have an Fm7,

176
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,890
that one's a little tough to grab right down here,

177
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,210
some guys just do it like this,

178
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,560
Fm7, big barre chord,

179
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,360
and here's a real common Cm7,

180
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,020
right there again, second finger is that C,

181
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,600
maybe a little bit of a stretch the first time you tried,

182
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,050
but I use that one all the time,

183
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,840
and of course, this guy Cm7 there,

184
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,680
which you've already been introduced, when we were doing our fifth string barre forms.

185
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,580
Okay, so we got major sevenths, we've got minor sevenths,

186
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,010
I did on those major sevenths, I did throw down there in your book,

187
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,540
you've got some open major seventh chords that you can use in different forms,

188
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,950
wouldn't sound as great with Jazz,

189
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,700
but you can use them in other styles of playing that you may need to do.

190
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,550
I also want to touch on a couple more, ninth chords,

191
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,480
okay, here's a good one,

192
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,990
based off of the fifth string and pivoting off the fifth string,

193
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,860
a C9, where's that C on that second finger,

194
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,355
I don't play,

195
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:00,720
It's just the inside four strings,

196
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,310
so I don't play the sixth string or the fifth first string,

197
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,670
so an Eb9 would be there.

198
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,680
Now there's one off of the sixth string, which is an A9,

199
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,060
which is a real pretty chord, I use this one a lot too,

200
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,090
again, I'm muting that fifth string,

201
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,190
so you can't hear him

202
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,290
and I don't play the last string,

203
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,590
if I did, it would end up changing into a thirteenth chord,

204
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,810
but that's an A9, C9, A9

205
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,970
and those are just some common forms for that.

206
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,700
Okay, now let's talk about Jazzing up your chord progressions,

207
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,700
well, one of the easiest thing to do is add color tones,

208
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,940
so if I'm, if it's a C chord that I'm looking at,

209
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,215
I can always add a color tone,

210
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,270
well, what is a color tone,

211
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,540
color tones are tones that are added to the chord,

212
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,280
still based off of the major scale,

213
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,920
so a C triad is C E G,

214
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,420
and the major seventh tone that would be that extra B,

215
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,320
one of the color tones, would be like your ninth eleventh and thirteenth,

216
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,800
now, which would be a D, would be the ninth,

217
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,520
so, a Cmaj9 would be C E G B D,

218
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,645
one way to jazz up chord progressions is

219
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,690
just by throwing extra color tones in there,

220
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,070
kind of gives it a sweeter sound,

221
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:23,600
so instead of C and an Am, let's say and a Dm and a G,

222
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,460
well, let's say I'm playing jazz,

223
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,040
well, maybe I want to do a Cmaj7,

224
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,270
maybe I want to do an Am11,

225
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,120
maybe a Dm9,

226
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,930
maybe a G9,

227
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,410
something like that,

228
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,340
okay, just gives it a different color.

229
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,830
Let's go through a couple of progressions

230
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,310
and see what are some other things that we can do to Jazz up our progressions,

231
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,715
one of the things that we can do,

232
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:51,950
other than adding color tones,

233
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,000
is adding what's called a ii-V progression,

234
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,940
ii-V are used a lot in in Jazz harmony all over the place,

235
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,300
what do I mean by that,

236
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,785
well, remember a couple of sessions back,

237
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:06,070
we talked about the harmonized major scale,

238
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,720
let's review,

239
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,240
if I'm in C,

240
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,390
the first chord is, C major, C E G,

241
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,205
the second chord is D F A,

242
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,370
and that ends up being a Dm chord,

243
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,835
that would be our two chord,

244
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:19,950
it's a minor chord,

245
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,510
if we jump up to the fifth,

246
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,280
our five chord would be a G B and D,

247
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,740
and that's back to a major chord,

248
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,360
so in any key,

249
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,545
If I want to get to that key,

250
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:32,010
I just throw a two and a five in

251
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,440
and it'll get me to whatever key I'm going in.

252
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,330
Let's take a look at that first example,

253
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,885
you've got two chords there,

254
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,890
you've got a Cmaj7 going into an Fmaj7,

255
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,990
pretty common progression,

256
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,880
Fmaj7,

257
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,235
now that's, that's pretty good,

258
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,100
but we can, let's see if we can Jazz it up

259
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,400
by using the ii-V of the key that we're going to.

260
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,720
So the first measure stays the same, Cmaj7,

261
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,590
and then, but look, I still have that Fmaj7 in bar three,

262
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,590
but in bar two I'm adding the ii and the V,

263
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,060
to right before in the key of F, right before that F chord,

264
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,875
not the ii V in C,

265
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,795
but the ii V of the chord that I'm going to,

266
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:19,150
have the key that I'm going to,

267
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,000
which ends up being a Gm and a C7.

268
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,490
Let's hear how that changes the sound a little bit,

269
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,690
ready go,

270
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,790
gave it a whole lot more color there, didn't it,

271
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,160
in the next exercise, I just do it again,

272
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,880
we have the ii V going into the F

273
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,390
and then I throw another ii V, going back into that C,

274
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,650
if we're going to repeat it,

275
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,270
let's hear how that changes the sound,

276
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,040
ready, go,

277
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,460
ii V in F,

278
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,350
then ii V in C.

279
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,250
Now, [] have created a much more interesting chord progression,

280
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,440
by just adding ii-V,

281
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,210
another good simple rule that you can use is,

282
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,580
whenever you have a dominant seventh,

283
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,045
this would be like a five chord,

284
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:18,880
a G7, C7 and F7, something like that,

285
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,955
you can always play around with that seventh

286
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:24,600
and add a bunch of stuff on that chord,

287
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,650
you can add a ninth, you can add eleventh,

288
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,215
you can add a flat nine, you can add a sharp nine,

289
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:32,640
you can add all kinds of things to that dominant seventh to give it extra color.

290
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,540
Let's take a look at those examples,

291
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,850
number four in your sheet,

292
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:44,690
starts with a Cm7 to an F7 to Bbmaj7,

293
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,700
let's say that's our base progression,

294
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,690
now the next one,

295
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:55,580
I have a Cm7 and then I throw in an F9, and then a Bbmaj7,

296
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,160
so I've given it a little bit of color with that F9 there.

297
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,110
Let's see what I did in the next one,

298
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,570
oh wow, I looked added some color tones,

299
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,120
Cm, I turned that into a Cm9,

300
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,410
the F7, I threw that all the way up to an F13,

301
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,460
the Bbmaj7 I turned him, turned him into a Bbmaj13,

302
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,605
and then look what I threw in,

303
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:20,350
I threw in A G augmented,

304
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,560
that would be like the V going back into that C,

305
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,140
that would be that form.

306
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,775
Okay, so a couple new forms for you,

307
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:30,390
but that's great,

308
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,245
learn all these forms,

309
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:32,870
write them down, get them underneath your fingers.

310
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,430
Let's try that last one again,

311
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,210
see how much that changed the tone,

312
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,540
of the, of the song that you're trying to do,

313
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,270
that's really Jazz chord progressions,

314
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,820
and color tones, you can throw some ii-V in,

315
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,980
always [] around with that dominant seventh,

316
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,480
you can get different colors there.

317
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,580
Now let's go on to our how music works section,

318
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,450
I want to learn what exactly are those ninth and elevents and thirteenths.

319
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,310
In our how music works section today,

320
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,240
I wanted to continue on learning how music is built together,

321
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,560
how these chords are built together,

322
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,430
we're almost through,

323
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,920
last time we went over the major seven and dominant sevenths and minor sevenths,

324
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,180
now we're just gonna kick that up one more third

325
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,000
and we're gonna add ninth,

326
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,420
and then another third on top of that is eleventh and thirteenth, thirteenth.

327
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,760
Okay, well, let's talk about some confusion right there,

328
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,830
don't get lost in all the numbers,

329
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,270
there's not,

330
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,175
There's ninth, eleventh and thirteenth is what we're talking about,

331
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,680
basically, there's the major scale,

332
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,705
and then, if you can imagine another major scale right next to it,

333
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:43,210
just like two octaves of a scale,

334
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,680
okay, so the ninth would actually be the second scale degree,

335
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,870
so if I was in C, the ninth would be a D,

336
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,470
see how that works,

337
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,580
the eleventh is actually the fourth scale degree, which would be an F,

338
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,300
the thirteenth in C would actually be an A, same as the sixth,

339
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,190
well, then why bother saying ninth, eleventh and thirteenth at all,

340
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,880
won't you just say second and fourth and sixth,

341
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,875
well, when I say ninth, eleventh and thirteenth,

342
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:13,800
I am telling you, secret by code, that there's a seventh in there,

343
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:22,780
okay, so a C9 would be a C E G Bb and a D,

344
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,695
why, where I get that Bb from,

345
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:26,800
remember our seventh rule from a couple of sessions back,

346
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,980
everything, it's always a flatted seventh,

347
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,730
unless it says the magic word, major seventh,

348
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,375
okay, unless it says the magic word,

349
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,105
a C9 did not say have the word major in it,

350
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:42,020
so, it's C E G Bb and D.

351
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,480
Okay, see how that works,

352
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,435
a C2 would have a C D E and a G,

353
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,910
but it wouldn't have that seventh in it,

354
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,260
so you see kind of difference,

355
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,025
the ninth involves that seventh,

356
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:54,050
that's why it's called that,

357
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,670
what would be an F9,

358
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,880
think about that at,

359
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,705
what would it be, an F9,

360
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:00,395
well, let's figure it out,

361
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:05,380
it'd be an one, three, five, flat at seventh, because it didn't say major, then ninth,

362
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,575
so it'd be an F,

363
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:10,330
it would be F A C Eb and G.

364
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,900
What about a Dm9,

365
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,920
what would that one be,

366
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,770
well, be one, flat three, five, flat seven, nine,

367
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,480
D F A C and E.

368
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,545
Let's do one more,

369
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:27,680
what about a Bbmaj9,

370
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,540
well, it'd be one, three, five, seven,

371
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,665
it did say the word major in there,

372
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:34,500
so it would be a seven and nine,

373
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,160
so in Bb, that would be Bb D F A and then C,

374
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,090
that's how ninth chords work and how ninth chords are spelled.

375
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,355
If we're to kick it up one more notch,

376
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:46,470
we get into eleventh,

377
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,845
a couple of quirky things happen

378
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:49,230
when we add eleventh to it,

379
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,010
basically we just go up another third,

380
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,620
so a C11 would be a C E G Bb D and now F,

381
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,750
now, in theory land, I have that E and that F both in that chord,

382
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,930
but in practicality, whenever there's that eleventh in there,

383
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,060
I don't include the third,

384
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,430
so it would, in practicality, when I'm actually playing it, I omit that third,

385
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,130
okay, so it be C G Bb D and F,

386
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,785
I just dropped that third,

387
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:21,150
because it would clash with the eleventh,

388
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,360
see how that works,

389
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,150
in F and F11 would be F C Eb G Bb.

390
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,650
Okay, what if I wanted an Fm11,

391
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,470
well, then I can still throw that third in there,

392
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,930
I don't have that half step clash like I did before,

393
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,980
so it becomes F Ab C Eb G Bb.

394
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,960
Okay, see how important it is

395
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,600
to know your scales, know your keys,

396
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,915
be able to spell these chords,

397
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,420
when we talk about soloing next section,

398
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,855
this is gonna become real key in knowing what notes are in these chord chords

399
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,210
as they're coming by on your piece of music.

400
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,270
Okay, the last one is thirteenth chords,

401
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,770
wow, we have covered so many different types of chords,

402
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,810
here's the last one,

403
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,890
okay, I just add one more third on top of that,

404
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,200
so, a C13,

405
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,370
well, let me back up,

406
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,200
with the thirteenth, you also again, you omit that eleventh,

407
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
because it would clash with that third,

408
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,955
so if I'm in C,

409
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:21,350
C13 would be C E G Bb D F but I'm going to omit it and then A,

410
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,870
see how that works,

411
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,160
so, wow you've got seven notes or six notes in that chord,

412
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,360
you're got an awful lot of notes that you're trying to keep track of,

413
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,730
generally, with the thirteenth chord,

414
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,425
just remember it's the sixth scale step,

415
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:35,200
but you do have that flat seventh in there.

416
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,620
Okay, let's talk about your assignment for this week,

417
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,770
here's your assignment,

418
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,360
I want you to practice the new major seventh, minor seventh and ninth forms,

419
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,950
get them underneath your fingers,

420
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,315
be able to play them in different places on the neck,

421
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:52,070
practice working out a chord melody using the examples in your book,

422
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,270
using the chord examples in your book,

423
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,105
try adding some of the extra chords that we talked about

424
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:59,270
and try to Jazz up those basic progressions,

425
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,050
practice that West Montgomery Jazz octave style,

426
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,755
you can get a lot of good mileage out of

427
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,050
just playing octaves with that.

428
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,200
Don't forget to use those Jam Along CDs for a lot more practice,

429
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,760
we'll go ahead and see you next time.

430
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,680
Okay, welcome to the workshop time,

431
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,190
here's where we get some of these chord forms underneath our fingers,

432
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,340
so that we can use them,

433
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,660
they'll be in our musical tool belt,

434
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,395
and we can whip them out,

435
00:21:31,395 --> 00:21:32,780
when it's time to play a jazz song.

436
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,740
Okay, first it starts off with the major seventh forms,

437
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,330
let's briefly review them,

438
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,040
in the sixth string, on the sixth string, we had that Fmaj7,

439
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,750
remember, don't play that last string, don't play that fifth string,

440
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,880
what if I wanted to play that Fmaj7 in a different place,

441
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,850
let's say I wanted to Bbmaj7,

442
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,020
where would it be,

443
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,200
in that form right there,

444
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,765
what if I wanted a Dbmaj7,

445
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:01,940
Where would it be in that form,

446
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,660
okay,

447
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,800
now remember some of the forms that we had on the fifth,

448
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,110
based on the fifth string,

449
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,030
this Bmaj7 form,

450
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,155
let's jump that around a couple different places,

451
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:16,680
what about an Ebmaj7 in that form,

452
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,220
what about Bmaj7,

453
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,005
okay, I could use some of these other ones,

454
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:31,420
there's a Bmaj7 there,

455
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,630
what about Ebmaj7 in another form,

456
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,880
another form,

457
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,210
another form,

458
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,440
another form,

459
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,660
another form,

460
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,455
six different forms,

461
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:49,360
we should be able to play that Ebmaj7 in many different places on the neck.

462
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,200
Let's go for some minor seventh forms,

463
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,180
make sure we got those,

464
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,340
okay, what about a Gm7,

465
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,350
well, I can do that all kinds of different ways,

466
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,580
I can do this one,

467
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,620
I can do this one,

468
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,870
I can do this one,

469
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,910
I can do this one,

470
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
all kinds of different options depending on where I want to go,

471
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,690
if I'm playing up here,

472
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,180
I would probably want to grab these up here,

473
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,345
if I'm playing down here,

474
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:14,870
there's no sense of me jumping away up here to this Gm7.

475
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,870
Okay, what about an Abm7,

476
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,880
where would that be,

477
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,900
well, I can do that a bunch of different places,

478
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:28,480
here or here, here, or even this one.

479
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,080
Great, what about an F9,

480
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,605
can you find an F9,

481
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:34,630
remember our ninth form,

482
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,090
well, here's our ninth form,

483
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,980
and then all I need to do is move it up to F

484
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,440
and I've got an F9,

485
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,190
or I have my other F form too,

486
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,320
I gotta get way up here at the top,

487
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,820
F9 up there as well.

488
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,050
What about a D9,

489
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,170
well, he would be there,

490
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,170
or there, if you want to try and do,

491
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,850
if you want to try and do it that way.

492
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,720
Let's play through some of the Jazz chord exercises that we have in your book,

493
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,770
okay, the first one, we're going from a Cmaj7 to an Fmaj7,

494
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,660
one, two, ready, go,

495
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,610
Fmaj7.

496
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,770
Let's do the second one,

497
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,120
ready, go,

498
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,700
here we add that ii-V, Gm7, C7,

499
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,740
do it again a little bit slower.

500
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,440
Number three, two, ready play,

501
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,550
let's do that again,

502
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,730
now if I wanted to just Jazz that up a little bit,

503
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,930
I could do something like this,

504
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,510
I just added a couple little extra notes in there,

505
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,250
use basically the same chord forms,

506
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,630
and we were able to get a little bit more mileage out of it,

507
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,210
almost making it a chord melody thing.

508
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,470
Okay, let's do some of the dominant seventh ones,

509
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,840
this would be exercise number four,

510
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,530
ready, go,

511
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,570
do it again,

512
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,490
let's go to the next one,

513
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,850
two, ready, go,

514
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,590
one more time.

515
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,010
Last one is that number six,

516
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,385
there we added a bunch of color chords on this color tone,

517
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:55,380
Cm9,

518
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,860
F13, or wait a minute, Cm9, we can do it down here, F13,

519
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,930
Bbmaj13,

520
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,210
G+7,

521
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,050
see how that augmented fifth only wants to lean down,

522
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,950
to that Cm9,

523
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,660
then the F13,

524
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,260
I could stay right there if I wanted to.

525
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,890
So I'm kind of making a little melody with those highest tones of those different chords,

526
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,380
here we go,

527
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,990
number six, ready, go,

528
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,170
now I can Jazz up the rhythm a little bit,

529
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,130
let's see what else we can do,

530
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,480
I just kind of made those base notes come down a little bit.

531
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,990
Great, you can have a whole lot of fun with Jazz chord forms,

532
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,070
and it just adds about probably about ten or fifteen different chords into your repertoire,

533
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,800
and it certainly gives you a whole lot more color that you can use.

534
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,390
Okay, we'll see you next time.
