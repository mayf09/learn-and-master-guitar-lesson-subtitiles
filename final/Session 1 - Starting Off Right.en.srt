00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,240
Hi, I'm Steve krenz

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,790
and I'd like to welcome you to learn and master guitar,

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,680
I am a professional guitarist,

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,090
I live here in Nashville Tennessee

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,910
and I teach and play and record every day,

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,640
in this session, we're going to cover the parts of the guitar,

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,020
how to tune the instrument,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,130
what are the names of the strings,

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,280
correct right and left hand technique,

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,140
how to read guitar tablature,

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,970
how to read guitar chords

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,710
and we're going to learn first two chords.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,690
So in our guitar tips section,

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,420
you're also going to be talking about getting your instrument ready to play,

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,870
setting up the action, changing the strings, those sorts of issues.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,720
In every session, there will be an assignment page at the end,

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,500
that shows you clearly exactly what you need to cover for the next coming session.

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,460
And in our workshop time,

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,750
I'll practice with you

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,000
over the material that you need to learn in order to move on,

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,440
are you ready to learn guitar,

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:13,290
let's go ahead and get started.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,660
Okay, the first thing we want to talk about is the parts of the guitar,

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,330
most guitars are pretty similar in their design,

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,010
this in acoustic guitar,

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,440
we have the body of the guitar right here,

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,490
you've got the neck right here,

28
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,560
the head stock here with the tuning pegs,

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,840
your guitar has six strings,

30
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,870
they're attached on this end by the tuning keys,

31
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,760
down on this end by the bridge,

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,530
there's a lot of tension on this bridge,

33
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,240
you always want to make sure,

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,780
that's attach nice and tight to your sound board of your guitar,

35
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,140
sometimes your guitar will have a pick guard here,

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,150
so it doesn't scratch up your guitar when you play,

37
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,180
these silver bars and the gold bars are frets,

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,000
we will learn an awful lot about frets

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,150
and where to where to put your fingers on them

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,380
as well as on the fret board.

41
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,560
So that's the parts of the guitar,

42
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,920
the next thing we need to learn is the names of our strings.

43
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,160
You have six strings on a guitar,

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,910
of course it's first through six,

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,340
but they're numbered from the thinnest string,

46
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,140
which is actually the bottom one,

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,290
up through the thickest, which is the top one,

48
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,640
so this would be the first,

49
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,260
this should be the second,

50
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,860
third,

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,240
and so on.

52
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,380
Now, they also have letter names that go along with them,

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,420
the musical alphabet goes from A to G,

54
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,000
so there's different letter names that correspond with each one of these strings

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,340
and that's one of the first things we need to learn,

56
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,780
so let's learn that first.

57
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,750
We're going to do three strings at a time,

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,810
when I when we do more than three strings,

59
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,830
everybody gets confused,

60
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,450
so we're just gonna do three strings at a time.

61
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,590
The first string is an E,

62
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,850
so go ahead and try and play E.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,170
Your second string is a B,

64
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,940
your third string is a G,

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,220
goes to those three, that's E B and G.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,580
So if I asked you,

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,290
what is the second string,

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,580
what would you think.

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
And if I said what is the first string.

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,970
And if I said G is on what string or which string,

71
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,170
what would you say.

72
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,540
Good, let's do the next three,

73
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,310
so we have E B and G,

74
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,570
we're going to the next three,

75
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,240
the fourth string is D,

76
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,410
the fifth string is an A,

77
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,800
and the sixth string is another E,

78
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,790
two outside ones, first string and six string are both E.

79
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,100
So let's put them all together,

80
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,730
are you ready?

81
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:15,240
E B G D A and E,

82
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,890
did you get all those,

83
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,300
alright, let's try,

84
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,000
if I said to you which string,

85
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,400
what is the note of the fifth string,

86
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,230
what would you say.

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,270
What about the second string.

88
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,940
What string is a D on?

89
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,740
What string is an A on?

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,750
Pretty good.

91
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,540
Alright, now let's talk about right-hand technique,

92
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,060
the first thing we need to talk about is our pick,

93
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,940
there's all different kinds of picks that you can use,

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,670
there's heavies mediums and lights,

95
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,170
different shapes and sizes,

96
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,860
I'd say the best thing to start out with is a medium pick

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
one of these teardrop shape ones.

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,020
And how do you hold it,

99
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,600
well, you put your pick in between your first finger and your thumb,

100
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,060
you want to kind of make a ninety degree angle right there,

101
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,240
between your thumb and the and the downward point of the pick,

102
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,900
now your first finger is kind of pointing out a little bit,

103
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,470
almost at a 45 degree angle out underneath that pick,

104
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,680
you've got oh what is that about a half an inch showing

105
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,780
and that's about how much you need to have

106
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,480
as far as your pick, you don't want to be up too high,

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,420
or out too wide on it,

108
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,590
about half an inch

109
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,630
and you hold it with a good strong grip,

110
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,290
one more thing,

111
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,870
we need to talk about with our right hand is bracing,

112
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,190
what that is,

113
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,680
is as we're playing the different strings,

114
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,440
you're going to need your hand is going to need some place,

115
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,240
that it can reference itself from,

116
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,520
whether it's, whether it's playing the second string,

117
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,170
or the fourth string, or the third string,

118
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,180
it's gonna get confused pretty quickly,

119
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,960
you'll find,

120
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,670
unless it's anchored somewhere,

121
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,470
so a good place to start,

122
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,360
different guitar players do it different ways,

123
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,320
but a good place to start is

124
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,290
to just put your pinky and let it touch the sound board,

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,710
I don't really particularly care where

126
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,820
and it doesn't have to touch hard,

127
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,870
just needs to touch it,

128
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,090
just helps your hand know where it's at

129
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,560
and what it needs to do.

130
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,520
All right, let's try and pick a couple of these different strings

131
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,500
and get some practice picking the strings.

132
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,520
Let's do the first string,

133
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,510
you ready?

134
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,260
Let's go.

135
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,860
Okay, what about the third string,

136
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,500
what's the name of that third string, do you remember?

137
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,360
Here we go, the third string.

138
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,120
Very good, the fifth string,

139
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,690
do you remember name that one?

140
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,000
Very good, now that's the right hand let's talk about the left hand as well.

141
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,260
Left hand, this is going to be the hand that you're going to be using to fret the different notes with.

142
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,190
How this works,

143
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,600
as far as the guitar is concerned,

144
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,670
you've got four fingers on this hand,

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,260
you don't really use your thumb,

146
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,850
some players, some country players do use their thumb

147
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,060
to kind of reach over and catch some of the lower bass notes,

148
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,430
but it's pretty tricky to do that

149
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,110
and not really all that effective,

150
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,810
so we're gonna go ahead and bring that wrist down,

151
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,830
and put this hand out,

152
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,450
like such,

153
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,380
you want make sure,

154
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,600
you want to make sure that there's air space right here,

155
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,030
you don't want your wrist to be way up like this,

156
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,160
or gripping the guitar very hard like that,

157
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,930
needs to be down a little bit,

158
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,030
got a little bit of air space in between there.

159
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,240
Now let's put our first finger on the first fret,

160
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,980
okay, where do we put our finger,

161
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,830
well, anywhere between here and here is fair game,

162
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,430
but having said that,

163
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,280
right up behind the fret,

164
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,060
is the easiest place to press it down with

165
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,660
and you get them best sound from it,

166
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,800
not on the fret,

167
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,800
a lot of folks think you might put your finger on the fret,

168
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,000
not at all,

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,900
that gets this kind of funky muted sound is not quite what you're going for,

170
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,510
you want to be hugging up right behind that fret.

171
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,760
Okay, ready, we're on the first string,

172
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,720
with our first finger,

173
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,190
we're gonna pick over here,

174
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,540
we're [] our hand,

175
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,730
and we do this first thing,

176
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,450
you ready,

177
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,920
let's play it together.

178
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,370
Do it again.

179
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,820
And one more time.

180
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,060
That's with our first finger,

181
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,130
now your first finger is going to cover anything that happens on any of the strings,

182
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,000
in this first fret.

183
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,940
Your second finger is going to cover anything that happens on any of the strings on the second fret,

184
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,910
let's try second finger,

185
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,110
so we released the first finger and put our second finger down here.

186
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,930
Okay, now let's try the third,

187
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,570
so we put third down nice and strong,

188
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,500
release the others up,

189
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,750
now some of you may be getting a buzzing sort of a sound,

190
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,500
kind of like this,

191
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,890
if your fingers aren't strong enough

192
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,430
to get good contact with that string to that fret board

193
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,110
you kind of end up with this buzzy sound,

194
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,570
all that's telling you is,

195
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,490
you're not making a good enough contact,

196
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,270
to make sure that fingers hung up right close back behind that fret,

197
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,430
that's the easiest place to put it down,

198
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,070
and there you wanna make sure you get a nice good clear sound.

199
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,880
Okay, now let's do pinky,

200
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,250
pinky is going to be the weakest of all of your fingers,

201
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,860
so you're gonna really have to put it down strong.

202
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,690
Let's try the pinky,

203
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,900
very good,

204
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,950
you want to make sure that,

205
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,500
your hand is not way up here like this,

206
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,770
all off centered with your fingers kind of aimed up this way,

207
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,280
you want that wrist down open up those fingers,

208
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,100
I bring it out like that where each finger is covering a fret,

209
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,880
a lot of players will come at it like this,

210
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,610
and then when they have to use something in that third or fourth fret,

211
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,200
they have to open up their fingers,

212
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,400
now your hand may not be used to staying out in apart like that,

213
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,440
and unfortunately with guitar playing,

214
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,270
you're gonna be doing this position an awful lot,

215
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,670
so eventually it will get more and more comfortable to you,

216
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,660
it may even be,

217
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,510
you know physically impossible for you to move your fingers very apart right now,

218
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,360
your fingers will limber up

219
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,040
as you do it just like if you would be stretching and doing stretching exercises,

220
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,740
they get more and more flexible, the more that you do it.

221
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,180
Let's try this one more time,

222
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,210
we're gonna be on that first string first fret,

223
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,550
here we go, let's play this note.

224
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,950
Second finger, second fret,

225
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,580
you want to make sure using your fingertips

226
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,470
not the flat of your fingers like that,

227
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,430
you don't want to be doing this,

228
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,030
that works real good on the first string,

229
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,190
but unfortunately doesn't work very good on the other strings,

230
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,270
so you always want to make sure that your fingers are using the tips.

231
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,950
So we did first, we did second,

232
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,970
here comes third,

233
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,840
and now we do fourth.

234
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
Let's do that one more time.

235
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:33,310
First, second, third, fourth.

236
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Now what should your thumb be doing back here,

237
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,970
well I don't really care what your thumb is doing back there,

238
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,580
the only problem is your thumb is attached to your wrist,

239
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,740
and I do care about where your wrist is at,

240
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,360
if your wrist gets too high,

241
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,610
you end up using the wrong kind of muscles

242
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,980
and it doesn't work very well for playing guitar,

243
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,780
you want to make sure that wrist is low,

244
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,670
you want to use your fine motor skills,

245
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,050
your little muscles in your fingers,

246
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,500
and bring that down

247
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,410
and so you don't want your thumb way up here like that,

248
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,340
it's not a hook,

249
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,260
you're not hanging your hand on your guitar,

250
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,760
you're gonna bring it back a little bit,

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,810
seem to like that.

252
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,920
Okay, let's talk about tablature,

253
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,650
tablature is a notations that guitars use

254
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,820
to show which fret and which finger needs to be played

255
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,930
at any particular time,

256
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,310
it's not really music notation,

257
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,900
we'll talk about music notation in a minute,

258
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,640
this is called tablature,

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,460
and it's something strictly for guitarists to use it,

260
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,760
it really helps you visualize what fingers you need to place where.

261
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,340
So if you can look at your book's figure one,

262
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,300
is a line of tablature

263
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,040
and let me just explain how that is,

264
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,380
those six lines represented there correspond to the six strings on your instrument,

265
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,940
going in reverse order,

266
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,840
so the top string is actually, the top line is actually your first string,

267
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,730
then it goes down to the six string.

268
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,870
In figure 2, where they put some numbers on it,

269
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,130
and this is they're telling you,

270
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,170
what they're trying to tell you there is

271
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,190
where to put your fingers,

272
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,140
what fret do you need to put your fingers on.

273
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,740
Okay, so the first notation there you see a little one right up at the top,

274
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,020
that's telling you on that first string,

275
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,390
they want you to put your first finger,

276
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,000
and play that note.

277
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,640
Okay, the next one after that is a 3,

278
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,530
but it's still on the first string,

279
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,780
so that means you put your third finger,

280
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,870
still on that first string right after that the next note,

281
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,570
after that it skips down you'll notice to the second string,

282
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,100
still the third finger though,

283
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,510
that's what that 3 is telling you.

284
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,010
So if I play just those three notes,

285
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,840
it would be like this,

286
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,420
first finger first fret,

287
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,350
third finger on that first string,

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,190
third finger on that second string,

289
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,970
you'll notice a little bit further on in that figure 2 exercise,

290
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,170
there's a 0,

291
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,560
what 0 is telling you is they want you to play that string,

292
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,230
the second string is the one that it's on open.

293
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,970
So I'm not fretting any fret at all,

294
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,140
I'm just playing it open.

295
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,890
Now, it's pretty easy when you get the hang of it to read this,

296
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,570
even though it looks a little confusing right now,

297
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,590
after you do it a little bit,

298
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,730
you kind of see how it goes,

299
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
so if I was to play figure 2,

300
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,000
it would be,

301
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,950
like this first finger, first string,

302
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,740
third finger first string.

303
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,970
third finger, second string,

304
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,840
second finger on the third string,

305
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,200
first finger, second string,

306
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,760
now here comes the open strings

307
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,240
and open second string and an open first string.

308
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,320
Now, if you look down to figure 3,

309
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,170
figure 3 represents how a chord would look,

310
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,360
all of these numbers stacked upon each other

311
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,930
are telling you to play all the strings at the same time.

312
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,020
Okay, so let's look on what's happening on each of these strings,

313
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,780
on the first and second string, you have 0s,

314
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,190
so that means those are both open,

315
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,800
on the third string, it has a 1 there,

316
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,650
that means you put your first finger down on that first fret,

317
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,410
on the fourth string and the fifth string, there are 2s,

318
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,720
which means that both the second, on the second fret, on both of those strings are being played

319
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,060
and the last one at the bottom is 0,

320
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,440
so that means that's open as well,

321
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,570
so if I play all of those together,

322
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,300
comes out to be a chord,

323
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,070
an E chord, you'll learn about that later.

324
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,090
That's how a chord would look in tablature.

325
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,370
Now we're going to talk about some finger exercises,

326
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,750
let's review,

327
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,120
on our right hand we used our pick

328
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,630
and we're going to start doing a picking pattern now.

329
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,030
Okay, so I want you just on that first string,

330
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,370
I want you to go a down stroke with your pick,

331
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,490
and then I want you to do an up stroke with your pick.

332
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,730
Then, let's do it down again, and up again.

333
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,790
Let's try that again, we're gonna go down up down up.

334
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,120
Are you ready on the first string?

335
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:10,070
Let's go, down up down up.

336
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,030
Very good

337
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,260
and that's the first string,

338
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,400
what's the name of that first string,

339
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,590
remember that that a E string,

340
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,340
let's do it, now we're going to do it on the B string, the second string,

341
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,650
we're going to do the same thing.

342
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,230
Are you ready?

343
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,900
Down up, down up,

344
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,450
remember be bracing your pinky on your sound board.

345
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,380
Let's try the third string, the G,

346
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,500
here we go, down up, down up,

347
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,980
you wanna go for a good steady rhythm,

348
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,210
go as slow as you need to go to get a good steady,

349
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,510
the idea is control, not speed,

350
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,370
if I can get you control,

351
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,360
then we can get faster but don't try and be speedy right here,

352
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,500
now it's not the time for it,

353
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,790
you want to get your hands in control,

354
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,810
you want your hands to be able do what your brain is telling them to do,

355
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,760
we are laying a good foundation with all this.

356
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,330
Okay, in the first finger exercise, you see,

357
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,390
we have the tablature line there

358
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,780
and we're gonna do down up down up with our right hand,

359
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,580
but we're going to put our first finger on this first fret, on the first string,

360
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,860
so it'll actually end up we'll be playing that four times down up down up,

361
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,800
and then we move to the second finger,

362
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,820
and we do the same thing,

363
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,330
then we do the third finger and the fourth

364
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,380
and back down,

365
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,760
so if I play that,

366
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,840
I'll play it nice and slow,

367
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,920
you try and play with me,

368
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,870
first finger first fret on the first string

369
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,680
and we're gonna go down up down up nice and evenly,

370
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,960
you're ready, let's play.

371
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:59,530
Down up down up,

372
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,990
now your second finger put him on the second fret,

373
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,690
here we go, down up down up,

374
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,180
now your third finger on the third fret,

375
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,600
down up down up,

376
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,500
your fourth finger, now your pinky stretching way out there,

377
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,790
up down up,

378
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:30,360
now back to the third down up down up

379
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:37,230
second, there you go and first.

380
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,060
Now this may be a little tricky at first to do,

381
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,190
everybody thinks they know how to control their fingers

382
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,450
until you start playing guitar,

383
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:54,180
then you realize that you don't know your brain really doesn't tell your pinky to move independently of the others very often,

384
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,600
so we have to kind of train our fingers to do what we need them to do.

385
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,360
Let's do the exercise one more time a little bit faster,

386
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,190
try and be steady,

387
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,500
you ready, here we go, let's play,

388
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,210
up down up,

389
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,040
second finger with no breaks in between right from one to the other,

390
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,850
third finger, fourth finger,

391
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,990
now down up down,

392
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,580
back to third,

393
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,630
you're doing great,

394
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,880
here comes second nice and steady,

395
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,850
back to first.

396
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,850
There you go,

397
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,370
now, we did that on the first string, the E string,

398
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,670
now we're going to go to the second string, the B string

399
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,500
and let's try that one more time,

400
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,330
this is still exercise number one,

401
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,280
we're just gonna do it on the second string now.

402
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,200
Ready, play.

403
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,950
Second finger now,

404
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,290
make sure you're not getting any buzzes,

405
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,270
puts a lot of pressure on those fingers,

406
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,600
here comes fourth pinky,

407
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,520
back to third now,

408
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,920
second finger,

409
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,090
and first finger,

410
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,190
very good, very good,

411
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,200
now probably right about now,

412
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
your fingers are getting a little sore,

413
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,460
which is what happens right about now,

414
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,710
because your fingers aren't used to doing that,

415
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,440
make sure using your fingertips,

416
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:54,200
and your finger, the flesh running your fingertips will tough enough,

417
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,790
at this stage of the game,

418
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,020
when you're practicing,

419
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,170
just play until your fingers start hurting,

420
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,480
once they start hurting, just back off from it for a while,

421
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,000
there's no advantage to playing through the pain or anything like that,

422
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,450
just just back off from it come back on a few hours later,

423
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,470
a little bit later on the night,

424
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,520
give your fingers a chance

425
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,460
to heal up a little bit and toughen up a little bit,

426
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,780
you'll find within about a week,

427
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,940
they'll be nice and strong

428
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,170
to be able to do what you need to do.

429
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,090
Let's go down to exercise number two,

430
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,760
now instead of going down up down up,

431
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,500
we're just going to go down up,

432
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,470
so instead of four beats, we've reduced it down to two.

433
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,870
Let's go to the third string now,

434
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,050
remember the name of that third string, G, here we go.

435
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,190
First finger, third string, good bracing,

436
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,180
here we go,

437
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,600
a little bit faster, down up,

438
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,040
now the second string, second finger, excuse me, down up,

439
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,410
third finger, fourth finger,

440
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,890
back to third,

441
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,520
back to second,

442
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,850
back to first,

443
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,630
now let's try to put them all together

444
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,310
instead of hesitating in between each one.

445
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,020
Ready, let's try it again,

446
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,710
let's play,

447
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,000
oops, sometimes you'll hit the wrong string, just like I did there,

448
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,260
try one more time,

449
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,560
this will be the third third string, the G string,

450
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,040
two beats on each, ready go,

451
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,840
next one,

452
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,740
third, fourth,

453
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:40,880
back to third, second, first.

454
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,150
Alright, let's go out to exercise number three,

455
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,760
now instead of just doing two beats,

456
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
we were doing four initially,

457
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,460
then we are doing two,

458
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,140
now we're just going to be down to one.

459
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,600
Okay, let's go back to the first string.

460
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,210
Brace now,

461
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,800
we're just doing down strokes on all these,

462
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,460
so just be down down down down is tried.

463
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,150
Ready, first string, go,

464
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:11,750
down, second finger, third finger, fourth finger,

465
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,050
back to third, second and first.

466
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,830
You should really do each of these exercises on all the strings,

467
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,330
it'll take a little bit of time

468
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,890
and it's pretty tricky at first,

469
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,510
but as you do it more and more,

470
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,010
your fingers will get better,

471
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,210
very quickly in being accurate on where they need to go,

472
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,300
it may seem difficult and a little hesitancy right now,

473
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,550
you may be trying to move your third finger

474
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,790
and it just takes you a second before you can actually move that third finger,

475
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,190
that's what, that's what these exercises are for,

476
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,470
they're not meant to be great music at this point,

477
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,300
before we can get to making great music,

478
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,610
I gotta get this hand, this hand fire in together,

479
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,380
so that's what these exercises are for.

480
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,720
Last two very quickly, exercise number four,

481
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,010
we're going to work out finger independence,

482
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,700
we're gonna go one two first second finger

483
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,490
and then first finger to third finger,

484
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,890
first finger to fourth finger,

485
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,750
first to third,

486
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,010
first to second,

487
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,140
so be like one two, one three, one four,

488
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,070
one three, one two and one,

489
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,380
let's go back to that first string one more time.

490
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,490
We'll do this one nice and slow.

491
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,100
Ready, play,

492
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,610
one, now two, okay,

493
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,300
then back to one,

494
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,530
we're going to go one three,

495
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,080
one three

496
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,520
and back to one,

497
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,840
we're going to go one four,

498
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,300
one four,

499
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,090
now we're going to do one three again,

500
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,460
one three,

501
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,390
one two,

502
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,880
one two

503
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,530
and then back to one.

504
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,690
Let's do that one a little bit faster now,

505
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,160
ready, play,

506
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:09,320
one two, one three, one four, one three, one two, one,

507
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,920
very good,

508
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,590
I know that maybe a little bit quick for you right now,

509
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,420
but do it a couple more days

510
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,280
and then you'll be you'll be [] on it.

511
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,960
Okay, the last one exercise,

512
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,540
for the last one I want to touch touch on,

513
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,130
this works out our pinky,

514
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,260
we're gonna go four three, four two, four one,

515
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,550
then it just does it again,

516
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,880
four three, four two, four one,

517
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,050
let's do it on a low string,

518
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,600
let's do it like on the fifth string, that A string,

519
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,240
you ready, nice and slow,

520
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,250
ready play,

521
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:49,530
four three, four two, four one,

522
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,510
make sure that wrist is down nice and low,

523
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,770
you're bracing you've got your pick fingering alright,

524
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,820
ready, go,

525
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,720
try one more time,

526
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:06,090
four three, four two, four one,

527
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:06,870
very good.

528
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
Okay, we're gonna talk about chords now,

529
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,310
I know you've been waiting for chords this whole lesson,

530
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,800
waiting through all of these finger exercises

531
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,770
and now we're finally last where we start to talk about chords,

532
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,300
which is the stuff you wanted to learn,

533
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,100
when you want to learn guitar anyway.

534
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,040
Chords are written in chord blocks,

535
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,630
it's again, it's a notation that chord that guitarists used to notate chords,

536
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,980
basically what you see in your book is a blank chord block,

537
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,000
basically it's a diagram of a picture of the end of your guitar,

538
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,970
if you can imagine the end of your guitar being like this,

539
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,930
the dark line at the top of the diagram is the nut right here

540
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,270
and then it goes down with each fret,

541
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,100
as you come down the chord diagram,

542
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,030
as you go across from top from side to side horizontally,

543
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,710
you goes across the strings,

544
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,230
just imagine like it would be a picture of the top of your guitar

545
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,790
going from the strings across like that.

546
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,000
Now the different lines and different circles mean different things,

547
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,520
so let me just explain those real quick before we get into that,

548
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,530
an open circle,

549
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,060
on them, you'll notice on the bottom diagram,

550
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,200
an open circle,

551
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,050
it has an open circle over that first string,

552
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,850
what that is telling you is

553
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,100
to play that string, but it's going to be open,

554
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,660
you're not going to be fingering any note with it,

555
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,250
let me just like that,

556
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,590
and let's see what's happening on the second string,

557
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,160
you've got a filled in circle on that first fret,

558
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,390
that's telling you they want you to put your first finger on that first fret,

559
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,120
okay and play that note,

560
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,190
so we've got an open one on the first,

561
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,560
first finger on that second string,

562
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,250
the third string, we've got another open,

563
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,700
then look what's happening on that fourth string,

564
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,880
we've got a filled in circle over the second fret,

565
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,890
that means put your finger there,

566
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,660
now which finger do you use,

567
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:00,330
well, the number underneath that filled in circle, that 2 is telling you,

568
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,090
that they want you to use your second finger to do that,

569
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,460
the numbers will not always be there,

570
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,080
but sometimes they're there,

571
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,400
so that 2 is telling you,

572
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,140
they want you to use your second finger for that.

573
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:17,860
On the fifth string, we've got our third finger there, on that third fret,

574
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,740
so let's see if we can play all of these together.

575
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,110
Okay.

576
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,090
Very good,

577
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:29,600
now, you'll notice,

578
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,730
on the fifth string, we've got an x,

579
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,060
excuse me, on the sixth string, the bottom string, we've got an x,

580
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,960
what is that telling you,

581
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,810
well, that's telling you not to play that string,

582
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,790
some chords are six string chords,

583
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,350
some chords are five string chords,

584
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,000
some chords are four string chords,

585
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,160
this one is a five string cord,

586
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,630
the C chord that we're learning now.

587
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,060
So we don't play that six string at all,

588
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,810
so make sure don't get sloppy and play that six string anyway,

589
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,740
that wouldn't be right,

590
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,950
you're just playing from the fifth string down.

591
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,350
Now you try.

592
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,290
You really got to press those fingers down

593
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,820
in order to get it to sound out right,

594
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,130
okay, you're ready to learn your first two chords.

595
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,210
The first chord is a C chord,

596
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,590
now you notice,

597
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,030
on this diagram,

598
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,400
it doesn't have anything over that six string,

599
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,320
sometimes an x will be there

600
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,790
to tell you not to play that string,

601
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,160
sometimes if it doesn't have anything on that string,

602
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,200
a filled in circle or an open circle,

603
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,000
it's telling you not to play that string as well,

604
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,070
they just give you the ones that you're actually supposed to be playing.

605
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,560
Let's try that C chord one more time,

606
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,240
starting at that fifth string,

607
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,350
we're gonna go through it,

608
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,810
each string, one string at a time.

609
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,830
Ready, starting on the fifth string,

610
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:58,120
third finger, second finger, open, first finger and open.

611
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,780
Now we're going to play all of them together,

612
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,930
ready to get back up to fifth, fifth string,

613
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,060
let loose, we're gonna play them all together,

614
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,470
ready go,

615
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,300
one more time.

616
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,870
Now, sometimes your chord may sound,

617
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,280
if you don't have your fingers in the right spot,

618
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,870
you kind of get a couple notes that aren't sounding particularly right

619
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,910
or they're buzzing in some in some respect,

620
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,410
check your hand position,

621
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,590
well, this is that C that I was trying to play,

622
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,720
on that fifth string and it's too far back,

623
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,430
I've got to move that finger,

624
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,960
where it's just hugging up behind that fret,

625
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,480
and then it comes out nice and clear.

626
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,770
Now, if you don't have good hand strength

627
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,210
and that's what we're building up right now,

628
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,360
it may kind of even though you have your finger right spot,

629
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,370
it may come out as kind of a dead note like that,

630
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,710
the only difference between this and this,

631
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,620
is putting my fingers down a little bit stronger,

632
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,900
if you notice I didn't move my fingers at all,

633
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,250
it's basically how hard I'm pressing it down,

634
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,050
if you press it down hard enough,

635
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,180
eventually that chord will open up and [] up,

636
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,800
that's a C chord.

637
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,810
Now the second chord, we're going to learn is a G7 chord,

638
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,570
C is probably the most common chord you're ever gonna find,

639
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,930
G7 is probably the next common most common chord you're going to play.

640
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,310
Here, let's go through a string by string,

641
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,450
that first string I've got my first finger, on that first fret,

642
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,880
then the second string, third string and the fourth string are all open,

643
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,710
that's easy,

644
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,360
now on the fifth string, I've got my second finger

645
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:43,100
and on the sixth string the lowest string, that E string remember,

646
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,870
I've got my third finger.

647
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,250
Let's play them all together,

648
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,770
now all together.

649
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,120
Very good,

650
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,090
okay, if you look at exercise number one,

651
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,770
if you look at exercise number one,

652
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,480
it goes through the C and the G7 chord,

653
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,920
alternating between the two,

654
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,240
so let's start with that,

655
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,830
here's the C chord,

656
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,820
take a second, get all of your fingers in the right spots,

657
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,890
and that diamond right there is just telling you that,

658
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,720
you play that C chord and just hold it,

659
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,850
until it's time for the next G7,

660
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,590
so let's play that C chord first.

661
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,180
Ready, go.

662
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,240
Now let's switch over to that G7,

663
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,750
I can move my third and second finger just up a string,

664
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,030
and I move my first finger down a string

665
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,140
and I'm there.

666
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,860
Now I go back to the C chord,

667
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,200
I move those back into place there,

668
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,360
this one up and I'm at a C chord.

669
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,510
Back to the G7.

670
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,740
And now to the C chord.

671
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,850
We better try that one one more time,

672
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,380
somehow getting all those chords and the fingers together

673
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,120
and all that takes a little bit of time and effort

674
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,470
to do that one more time,

675
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,730
start on that C chord.

676
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,940
Now switch that G7.

677
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,260
You may have to do it finger by finger

678
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,510
or if you can do it all together, that's even better,

679
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,560
let's do a G7.

680
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,370
Back to the C chord now,

681
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,870
five string chord remember,

682
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,700
don't play that lowest six string.

683
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,870
Back to G7, all the strings are used on the G7.

684
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,410
And then back to the C.

685
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,680
Take a look at exercise number two.

686
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,240
This is called slash notation,

687
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,950
you'll see this quite a bit as a guitar player,

688
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,390
there's something we play in quite a bit,

689
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,710
the different slashes,

690
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,490
all that's telling you,

691
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,050
at this stage of the game is

692
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,620
you're gonna be strumming one strum for each slash that you see,

693
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,050
okay, so let's get our C chord back up again.

694
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,130
And let's do exercise number two.

695
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,100
Ready, play.

696
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,810
Three four, the next measure,

697
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:20,490
one two three four,

698
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,850
now G7, switch over to G7,

699
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:29,590
one two three four,

700
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:35,420
next measure, one two three four,

701
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:42,300
and back to that C, one two three four.

702
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,780
Very good, now take a look at exercise number three,

703
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,870
now we're gonna alternate those chords a little bit quicker,

704
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,770
which, as I know it's probably going a little fast for you,

705
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,150
but let's try it,

706
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,340
you're ready start on that c.

707
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,210
Let's go.

708
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:04,520
One two three four,

709
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,930
now to the G7,

710
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,080
try not hesitate between each chord.

711
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,470
Back to C.

712
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,400
G7, here you go.

713
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,300
Back to C.

714
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,400
Very good,

715
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,190
that's the C and that's the G7 chord,

716
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,260
now may have moved a little fast for you,

717
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,850
may have trouble keeping up at this point,

718
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,110
but after we do it

719
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,450
and we go through our workshop time here in a minute,

720
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,240
then you'll be able to knock these out pretty quickly.

721
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,320
Okay, welcome to get our tips,

722
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,460
on this segment, we're going to talk about specific things that have to do with guitar playing,

723
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,520
that aren't necessarily the technique stuff that we've been governed in the other section.

724
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,220
These are some things these are some items,

725
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,010
that I would suggest you get from the very beginning,

726
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,780
if you're interested in starting to play guitar,

727
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,370
you can pick these up on our website,

728
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,900
or you can also check your local music store.

729
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,610
First thing we're gonna talk about is

730
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,960
one of the most useful things is an electric guitar tuner,

731
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,000
they come in different shapes and sizes,

732
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
this is a pretty standard one,

733
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,360
you would plug your guitar

734
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,890
and your guitar would have to have a pickup,

735
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,010
in either an electric guitar or an acoustic guitar like this one,

736
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,300
that does have a pickup in it

737
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,120
and you plug it in and it helps your guitar tune.

738
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,270
And as you can see,

739
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,600
the tuning is a little bit of a tricky subject,

740
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,710
if you try and do it manually,

741
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,150
so electric tuner like this,

742
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,560
sometimes you don't even need to pick up,

743
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,120
they have microphones in them

744
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,410
and you just play the note

745
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,670
and it tells you whether you need to loosen the string or whether you need to tighten the string

746
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,280
and when you get in, when you get the dot in the middle,

747
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,050
then you've you're in tune.

748
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,540
Another thing I would suggest you get right from the very beginning,

749
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,720
is a string winder,

750
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,780
a little thing like this probably just cost a buck or two,

751
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,240
when you're changing strings,

752
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,680
this is a lifesaver,

753
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,010
because you'll be winding and winding these strings all day long,

754
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,480
if you don't have a string winder,

755
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,630
so it's well worth the buck and a half to get one of these.

756
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,690
Next thing I would suggest is a case,

757
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,830
some of you may have cases that had come with your guitar,

758
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,600
a lot of guitars don't come with cases,

759
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,140
they just come in a box shipping container,

760
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,330
so you don't want to use that as your case,

761
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,800
it's good for you to go ahead and get a case,

762
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,790
now there's three different types,

763
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,170
you can get a hardwood case,

764
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,240
which that's as strong as you can get,

765
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,370
and that's maybe a little bit more than you're you're wanting to spend,

766
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,300
they're pretty pricey,

767
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,710
but they do protect your instrument,

768
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,000
the best it can be,

769
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,840
that kind of step down from that is called a chipboard case,

770
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,220
it's a solid case,

771
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,350
but it's almost made out of a cardboard,

772
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,760
a strong cardboard material,

773
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,020
that's a chipboard case,

774
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,490
that's good for a plugging your guitar around getting in and out of the car that sort of thing,

775
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,460
the third type of cases,

776
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,440
a soft case, a padded case,

777
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,470
you put your guitar in this kind of zip it all up,

778
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,460
carried on your back

779
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,320
and carry it out of the car,

780
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:07,090
it isn't as protective as the hard cases,

781
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,880
but it does offer some great advantages in portability.

782
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,430
Some of the little things that I would suggest you get a metronome,

783
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,640
here's a pretty standard metronome,

784
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
they also come in different kinds too,

785
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,610
only thing a metronome does is click off a tempo,

786
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,900
a good steady tempo,

787
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,690
I can speed it up, and slow it down,

788
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,230
they have electronic ones as well.

789
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,070
Now I encourage you to get there's all kinds of metronomes,

790
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,190
some of them offer a beep, where it just beeps at you,

791
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,930
other ones you have a click

792
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,630
and I would definitely recommend you get the ones that have a click,

793
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,330
not that has a little beep that goes past,

794
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,640
it sounds good, when you're listening to it,

795
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,620
but when you actually start playing with one that has a beep,

796
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,560
you'll realize it's much better to have one that has a click.

797
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,350
Also I would encourage you to get a music stand,

798
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,030
you can get the little wire ones,

799
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,990
or you can get a little more sturdy metal music stands,

800
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,250
place for you to put your music,

801
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,770
put your resources that you're going off of,

802
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,180
so you're not just sitting on the couch,

803
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,150
looking at it far away at a coffee table or something like that.

804
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,040
Now, some other things I would suggest you have done with your guitar.

805
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,430
Because you want to make sure that your guitar is easy to play,

806
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,350
there's nothing worse than playing a guitar that is just difficult to play,

807
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,840
it gets you frustrated hurt your fingers

808
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,790
and you end up wanting to chuck the whole thing,

809
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,010
so it's a very good idea to have your guitar setup is what they call it,

810
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,510
have a setup done on your guitar,

811
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,280
what they what they do is,

812
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,360
they look at your guitar

813
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,810
and they look and make sure that your whether your neck is straight,

814
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,270
you can do a visual check of that yourself at home

815
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,760
by just kind of looking down the neck of your guitar,

816
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,270
and making sure it's pretty straight,

817
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,450
you don't want it bowing in or bowing back out again.

818
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,220
And they can adjust your guitar through a metal raw,

819
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,050
that's actually inside of your sound hole here,

820
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,280
it's called a truss rod,

821
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,210
so it can be adjusted,

822
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,500
its not that big of a deal at all.

823
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,640
The other thing that you want to check on your guitar is the bridge,

824
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,040
your bridge is this right here,

825
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,850
remember we talked about,

826
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,730
that you want to make sure there's no gaps between it and the sound board,

827
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,100
there should be no gaps,

828
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,940
if there is gaps,

829
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,350
that means it's pulling up

830
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,610
and that's not good news.

831
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,430
You also want to have adjusted

832
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,390
and this is part of a set up job, is your action,

833
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,120
what action is the distance of the strings from the fret board,

834
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,360
the higher this is, the wider that action is,

835
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,960
the more difficult that guitar is going to be able to play,

836
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,180
the closer that is to these frets,

837
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,680
the easier it's going to be able to play,

838
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,710
if your guitar is hard and difficult to finger

839
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,330
and get those notes down without buzzing,

840
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,800
have your action checked,

841
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,510
that's probably one of the best things you could do.

842
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,270
How do you how should you take care of your guitar,

843
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,820
well, just for just for a second, let's talk about that,

844
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,710
you don't want to get your guitar too hot,

845
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,720
you don't want you to get your guitar too cold,

846
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,570
your guitar really is just wood and glue

847
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,490
and so if you get this thing too hot,

848
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,640
it starts warping and coming undone,

849
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,280
I can put a heat lamp on this bridge

850
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,230
and in about five minutes, it peels right up,

851
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,430
so it really is just wooden glue,

852
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,140
so you want to make sure you don't do stupid things,

853
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,520
like take your guitar in the car in the mall in the middle of summertime,

854
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:28,140
that temperature inside your car is probably going to get about 150 degrees at least,

855
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,990
that's well enough to do pretty serious damage to your guitar,

856
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,630
so you just want to be real careful with that,

857
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,550
it can be hot, but not really hot,

858
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,410
also, you don't want to get your guitar super cold

859
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,210
or change temperature really fast,

860
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,500
it's in the middle of winter,

861
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,820
your guitar has been out in the car,

862
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,960
it's well below freezing,

863
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,670
you bring it in whip it out,

864
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,460
you're going to practice like like I said you should,

865
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,210
that's great,

866
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,950
but you set your guitar next to a heater vent,

867
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,390
that would be bad,

868
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,110
your guitar ever so slightly expands and contracts,

869
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,450
and it would crack the finish on top of your guitar,

870
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,010
it won't affect how it's going to sound,

871
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,720
but it's not going to look very pretty, from then on,

872
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,190
and there's once you crack your finish,

873
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,630
there's no going back,

874
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,190
it's like cracking a windshield on a car.

875
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,200
Last thing,

876
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,920
you want to be careful not to set anything on top of your guitar,

877
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,390
even when you put it in the case,

878
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,160
you don't want to put your [] on top of your guitar

879
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,840
or put any weight on it down this way,

880
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,340
there's just not any bracing that way,

881
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,210
and it could crack,

882
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,790
those are just some tips on caring for your instrument

883
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,110
and knowing what to look for

884
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,420
and some things you should buy at the very beginning.

885
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,430
Alright, here's your assignment for this session,

886
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,350
we've done what we've covered a lot of ground,

887
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,670
but here's what you need to do

888
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,350
in order to move on for the next session.

889
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:40,000
Do all of the finger exercises in your book on all of the strings

890
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,350
to toughen up your fingers

891
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,680
and also to build motor skill development and control.

892
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,520
Second thing you need to do memorize the names of your strings.

893
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,850
Third thing you need to do practice that C and G7 chord

894
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,220
and the exercises that are within,

895
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,380
each note should sound out clearly

896
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,900
and try not to hesitate when you're changing chords,

897
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,550
if you do all of these things,

898
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,720
and practice them faithfully over the next coming days,

899
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,310
you will be ready for the next level

900
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,900
and I'm going to help you practice,

901
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,130
when we get to the workshop time,

902
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:09,910
I'll see you there.

903
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,590
Okay, welcome to the guitar workshop time,

904
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,680
this is this is the portion where we get to practice together,

905
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,630
first thing we do before we practice,

906
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,060
wheedle hand stretching exercise,

907
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,350
so I want you to get your hands,

908
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,920
put a fingertip to fingertip,

909
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,470
start pressing down,

910
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,330
we're stretching out these muscles,

911
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,740
you're not trying to break your fingers,

912
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,750
now, you're just trying to stretch them down,

913
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,400
last thing to come down as your palm,

914
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,050
then your palm comes up,

915
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,110
stretch these out here.

916
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:41,970
Can you feel the difference,

917
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,800
can you feel those muscles stretching out in there,

918
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,390
that's a good way to get your hands warm

919
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,500
before we get ready to play.

920
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,480
Now, let's do these finger exercises,

921
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,920
that we talked about on your page,

922
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,110
we start out with the first finger exercise,

923
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,390
number one, remember we're going down up down up with our hand, right hand

924
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:05,630
and we're going to go one two three four, three two one with our left hand,

925
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,580
we will do it slowly at first

926
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,400
and then we'll play one time a little bit faster.

927
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,310
Here we go, down up down up with our pick,

928
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,050
ready, go,

929
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,040
first finger,

930
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,890
second finger,

931
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,170
third finger,

932
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,610
fourth finger,

933
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,600
back third,

934
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,330
second,

935
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,700
first,

936
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,730
let's do that again,

937
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,630
go back up to second,

938
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,130
second,

939
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:55,920
there you go,

940
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,870
third,

941
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,800
fourth,

942
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,830
third,

943
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,570
bracing your hand slow and steady,

944
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,860
make sure your fingers are doing exactly what they need to be doing.

945
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,270
Very good,

946
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,270
now we're gonna do that one just a little bit slightly faster,

947
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,680
see if you can keep up.

948
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:31,880
Ready, go.

949
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:43,120
Your fingers should be moving just like a machine,

950
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,390
back to third,

951
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,030
fingers that aren't being used

952
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,600
should be just hovering right above the fret board where they need to go,

953
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,410
slow even strokes,

954
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,570
try one more time, a little bit faster,

955
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:01,860
ready, go.

956
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:21,070
Very good, let's go to the second string,

957
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,790
what's the name of that second string, that's your B string,

958
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:25,960
try here we go,

959
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:39,010
ready, go.

960
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,340
Very good, now stood on the third string.

961
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,840
Ready, play.

962
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:17,640
Fourth string,

963
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,840
nice and even and steady

964
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,360
you're doing great,

965
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,170
keep those fingers down.

966
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,020
Fifth string, try it,

967
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:38,670
ready go,

968
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:53,220

969
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,000
Last string, low E string

970
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,310
and ready play,

971
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,710
keep that wrist down,

972
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,780
make sure you're bracing on that right hand,

973
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,300
good pick position,

974
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,350
a little bit tough to push down,

975
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,470
you may be buzzing on a couple of these,

976
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,990
maybe hugging up right behind that fret,

977
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,680
here we go.

978
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,980
very good, that's exercise number one,

979
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,300
let's do exercise number two.

980
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,740
Now instead of going down up down up,

981
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,300
we're just gonna go down up,

982
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,120
okay, let's go back to our first string again.

983
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,490
Ready, go,

984
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,090

second string, go,

987
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,390
third string, a bit faster now,

988
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:20,340
fourth string, a little bit faster, even still,

989
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:29,160

991
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,210
Very good, exercise three,

992
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,760
now we're just doing down just one on each,

993
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,770
okay let's start a little bit slower back on that,

994
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,420
well let's go back to that six string,

995
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,350
let's start there,

996
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,250
change it up a little bit.

997
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,290
Ready, go,

998
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:10,520

second string, faster,

1002
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,590
there you go, fingers work

1003
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,700
and first string.

1004
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,300

1011
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,790
Skip over the fifth string,

1012
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:33,880
one two, one three, one four, one three, one two one.

1013
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,300
Last exercise there believe it's your fifth exercise there,

1014
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,970
four three, four two, four one,

1015
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,920
let's touch on that first string,

1016
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,930
ready, go,

1017
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:49,990
four three, four two, four one,

1018
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:57,070
second string, four three, four two, four one,

1019
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,150
third string.

1020
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,440
Very good little bit faster,

1021
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,700
fourth string,

1022
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,070
fifth string, faster,

1023
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,250
six string, faster still.

1024
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,600
Okay, now let's work on our chords,

1025
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,340
remember our two chords that we did,

1026
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,050
the C one is the first one,

1027
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,860
let's make sure we form it right,

1028
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,630
it's a five string chord,

1029
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,170
third finger on that fifth string, third fret,

1030
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,990
second finger, fourth string, second fret,

1031
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,030
the G on the third string is open,

1032
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:42,140
first finger on that second string first fret C,

1033
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,610
the last one is open,

1034
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:44,870
play altogether.

1035
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,380
Now, all at the same time,

1036
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,260
that's our C chord.

1037
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,570
Let's form our G7 chord,

1038
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,730
switch our fingers over,

1039
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,480
remember your third and your second finger just need to go up one string set

1040
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,070
and they're already where they need to be,

1041
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,430
move that first finger down one string set

1042
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,930
and he's where he needs to be,

1043
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,870
G7 [] go through, each one note at a time,

1044
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,350
all together.

1045
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,950
Alright, now we're gonna jump between those chords,

1046
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:27,820
okay, starting an exercise one on the chord examples,

1047
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,350
starts on the C chord,

1048
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:31,740
let's do four counts

1049
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,680
for each one of those notes that you're holding it for.

1050
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,530
So let's go, ready play,

1051
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:41,040
C chord, one two three,

1052
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,470
now change that G7 go, two, three,

1053
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,480
back to the C now, two three,

1054
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:57,140
G7, two three four

1055
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,980
and back to C.

1056
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,050
Pretty good,

1057
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:00,530
let's try it,

1058
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,580
let's speed it up just a little bit,

1059
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,770
ready, play,

1060
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,800
C, one two three,

1061
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,690
G7, two three,

1062
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,830
back to C, two, three,

1063
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:18,720
G7, two, three,

1064
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,620
back to C.

1065
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,570
Great, let's move on to exercise number two,

1066
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:28,160
remember we do a strum for each slash that's on the page,

1067
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:31,760
remember for a C chord, don't be hitting that low sixth string,

1068
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,680
just five strings on the C chord,

1069
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,440
ready, let's start nice and slow exercise two,

1070
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,810
ready go.

1071
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:47,870
Slow even strums, one two three,

1072
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,260
G7 now, switch your fingers over go,

1073
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:59,320
one two three,

1074
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,400
back to C.

1075
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,050
Pretty good, let's try one more time,

1076
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,760
ready, a little bit faster,

1077
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,050
this time starting on the C,

1078
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:11,800
ready,

1079
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:21,770
here you go here comes out G7, go,

1080
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:28,900
get ready for that C chord,

1081
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,000
be thinking where you put your fingers go.

1082
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,880
Very good, one more time,

1083
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,140
a little bit faster,

1084
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,790
ready, go.

1085
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,980
Even strums,

1086
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,320
push down those fingers nice and hard.

1087
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,970
Very good,

1088
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,770
let's move on exercise number three,

1089
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:00,020
now we're gonna switch those chords a little bit faster,

1090
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,220
we're going to go between the C and the G7,

1091
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,260
but only four beats in between each,

1092
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,910
ready play,

1093
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,750
C,

1094
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,260
now G7,

1095
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,870
back to C,

1096
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,980
G7,

1097
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,750
back to C,

1098
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,530
how are you doing,

1099
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,950
you're hanging in there still one more time,

1100
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:29,060
a little bit faster, this time,

1101
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,680
ready, go,

1102
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,220
G7,

1103
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,800
back to C,

1104
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,760
pretty good, G7,

1105
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,140
C.

1106
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,890
Okay, this will be the last time we do it,

1107
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,780
so really going to kick it up a notch on the speed,

1108
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,950
see if you can keep up,

1109
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:55,680
ready, go,

1110
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,150
G7,

1111
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,930
back to C,

1112
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,010
G7,

1113
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,990
back to C.

1114
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,720
Very good, I hope you've learned something this first session,

1115
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,360
a couple things I want you to think about as you're practicing,

1116
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,980
remember about fifteen minutes or more five out of seven days a week

1117
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,800
is a good place to start on practicing,

1118
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,580
you will only improve by the methods effort that you put in it,

1119
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,400
man, I wish I could just tell you the information

1120
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:28,510
and you would get it,

1121
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,750
but unfortunately, there's a lot of stuff that you got to do on your end,

1122
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,860
which is practicing,

1123
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,010
so I encourage you to do that five out of seven days a week,

1124
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,970
fifteen minutes or more,

1125
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:40,460
if you can pull up to thirty minutes five out of seven days a week,

1126
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,060
that's great,

1127
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,770
doesn't have to be at the same block either,

1128
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,540
you can just do a few minutes in the morning,

1129
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,920
maybe a few minutes at nine,

1130
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,710
keep working hard at it and I'll see you next time.
