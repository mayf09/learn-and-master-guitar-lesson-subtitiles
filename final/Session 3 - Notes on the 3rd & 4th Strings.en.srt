1
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,960
Okay, welcome to session three.

2
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,930
We're going to cover two more musical concepts, ties and dots,

3
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,730
before we're ready to move on to the next section.

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,750
Let's talk about ties first,

5
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,790
the problem we have is,

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,740
we need to have long notes in music,

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,200
now whole note will hold for four beats we learned about that,

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,420
but what if I want to hold for six beats

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,480
or eight or something beyond a bar line,

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
how do we do that,

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,160
well, we cover that problem with a thing called a tie,

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,500
that arc line that you see,

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,430
over those two notes,

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,880
that is what's called tie

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,820
and it is linking those two notes together,

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,310
so as you're seeing in that first example,

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,690
the whole note is tied over the bar line to the half note,

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,770
how this is played,

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,090
the half note gets two beats, the whole note gets four beats,

20
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,640
so I add all those together,

21
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,500
I don't replay that half note,

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,280
when I get to it,

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,590
I just give its two beats to the whole note

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,690
to make a total of six beats,

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,370
see how that works,

26
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,140
I'm just tying those two notes together,

27
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,460
I don't replay that second note,

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,930
I just add them both together.

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,650
In example two, you'll see a quarter note, half note

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,520
and then a quarter note that's tied over the bar line to a note of the same pitch,

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,160
ties are always to the note of the same pitch,

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,230
you're never going to see it going between different pitches,

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,930
they're going between different pitches, that's what's called a slur

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,030
and we don't really see those too much in guitar music.

35
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,440
So, the tie goes over the bar line

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,630
with those quarter notes, then another quarter note

37
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,600
and then a half note tied over to a whole note.

38
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,640
So if I was to play this,

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,670
I'm just going to do on a first string E,

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,120
and I'll play that example 2,

41
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,550
ready, go,

42
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,370
one, one two,

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,920
tied over the bar line here,

44
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,650
one two, one two three four,

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,790
see how that works.

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,940
The next concept, we need to talk about is dots,

47
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,970
now dots add something to the note,

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,250
dots add, here's the rule,

49
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,780
dots add one half of whatever they're attached to,

50
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,490
what do I mean by that,

51
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,570
well let's look at our example,

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,190
in our half note example,

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
I have a half note with a dot on it,

54
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,900
a half note gets two beats,

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,990
the dot, what is the dot get,

56
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,780
the dot gets half of whatever it's attached to,

57
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,000
so half note gets two, the dot would then get one,

58
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,550
so you add them all up together and that gets three.

59
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,810
Our next example is a whole note,

60
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,030
what if I put a dot on a whole note,

61
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,080
usually about this stage,

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,740
everybody gets it,

63
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,810
I get it, a dot adds one,

64
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,630
well, it's a little more to it than that,

65
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,450
if it's attached to a half note, it adds one,

66
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,270
if it's attached to a whole note, it adds more than that,

67
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,700
let's figure it out, a dotted whole note,

68
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,290
the whole note gets four,

69
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,970
the dot, what is the dot get,

70
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,460
half of whatever it's attached to,

71
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,290
half of four is two,

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,320
four plus two is six,

73
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,690
so a dotted whole note is going to be six,

74
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,250
you're going to see that very much,

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,140
but I wanted you to see the difference between the other one,

76
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,760
here's what you're going to see a little bit more.

77
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,490
A dotted quarter note,

78
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,530
now think about what would this be,

79
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,150
the quarter note gets one

80
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,980
and the dot what would the dot get,

81
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,560
the dot would just get a half,

82
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,960
because it's half of whatever it's attached to

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,250
and it's attached to just one,

84
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,580
so one plus a half be one and a half,

85
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,540
and that would make up a complete beat,

86
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,790
but usually you'd see it followed by another eighth note

87
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,500
and that's how they make those rhythms work.

88
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,030
And that's ties and dots.

89
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,320
Okay, let's talk about eighth notes,

90
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,030
now eighth notes are part of that group of rhythms that we talked about at the very beginning,

91
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,800
whole notes get four beats,

92
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,110
half notes get two beats,

93
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,020
quarter notes get one beat

94
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,150
and now we're going to subdivide that one beat,

95
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,830
we're gonna split the one beat,

96
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,040
and we're going to go to eighth notes,

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,660
which will each get a half a beat,

98
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,330
now as it's played on the guitar,

99
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,830
when you have several of the same note on the same string,

100
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,440
you would alternate your picking,

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,970
remember what we did in that first session,

102
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,980
we did a finger pattern of down up down up,

103
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,630
that we're going to apply that now and we're working with eighth notes,

104
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,460
if the notes are the same pitch,

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,290
let's say you had a bunch of Es in a row,

106
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,620
then instead of just going down down down down down down down,

107
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,870
you just go down up down up,

108
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,100
so I wouldn't go down down down down,

109
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,940
I would go down up down up.

110
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,190
Now one more thing about eighth notes,

111
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,200
when eighth notes are by themselves,

112
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,730
they have a flag on the stem,

113
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,370
you have the note head, you have a stem, you have a little flag on it,

114
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,410
when they're together, they're grouped,

115
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,210
when or when there's more than one,

116
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,890
whether there's two a group of more,

117
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,470
they're grouped together in twos usually

118
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,380
and they use a beam across the top of them,

119
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,090
so that's what you'll see when that beam is,

120
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,770
you may be confused about what that might be,

121
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,280
those are just eighth notes tied together,

122
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,050
somebody figured out a hundred fifty years ago,

123
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,820
that when you have a bunch of eighth notes in a row,

124
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,900
it's kind of difficult to read them,

125
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,950
they have all those flags,

126
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,120
so they just beam them together,

127
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
makes it a little bit easier to read.

128
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,130
So let's go through some of the eighth notes exercises in your book,

129
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,710
let's look at a eighth exercise number one,

130
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,930
that's on your first, E string,

131
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,640
we talked about down up down up,

132
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,170
when we get to the eighth notes,

133
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,920
let's play,

134
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,000
down down, down up, down up,

135
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,660
down down, down up, down up,

136
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,160
now next note F,

137
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,110
down up, down, down,

138
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:20,130
back to E, down, down up, down, two.

139
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,460
Got it,

140
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,110
see how those downs and ups work,

141
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,440
now that really only applies when it's of the note of the same pitch,

142
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,270
when you have a bunch of the same note in a row,

143
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,390
now you'll find out really quickly as we go through these exercises,

144
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,800
as you're jumping strings and stuff,

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,450
you really can't hold true to that down and up alternating pattern all the time,

146
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,890
it just doesn't work out that way,

147
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,050
your brain will figure that out pretty quickly,

148
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,290
but only when you have notes of the same pitch on the same line,

149
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,200
that you start doing alternating you'll be a little bit faster doing it that way.

150
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,980
Let's do a couple more, exercise number two.

151
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,970
This one starts on second string, first finger, C,

152
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,240
ready play,

153
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,400
rest, now up to G,

154
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:22,270
down these notes alternating your picking with each one and rest.

155
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,400
Okay, we're going to do exercise four now,

156
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,290
okay, I'm going to do a little bit faster,

157
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,750
so you try and do the best you can.

158
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:49,870
Ready go,

159
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,620
two three four

160
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,090
and that's how eighth notes work,

161
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,560
now let's learn a few more notes.

162
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,440
Okay, let's talk about the notes on the third string,

163
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,150
remember what the name of that third string is,

164
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,500
that's a G,

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,470
okay, G is open, and that will be our first note,

166
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,920
the middle, excuse me, the second line on your music notation is A G,

167
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,870
that's this third string open,

168
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,470
the next note we have is

169
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,910
our second finger, our first second finger note we had is an A,

170
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,680
second space up,

171
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,990
make sure you're fretting the note nice

172
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,630
and close to that fret not on the fret,

173
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,570
right back, so we have G

174
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,250
and we have A,

175
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,680
play with me, G and now A.

176
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,080
Very good, let's add those to our other notes,

177
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,900
we've got G and A

178
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,330
and now let's do B C and D on the next string,

179
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,230
B C D,

180
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,640
on the next string, we've got E F and G,

181
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,990
E F and G,

182
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,130
can you go backwards,

183
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,690
can you go backwards, the other way,

184
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:11,230
G F E, D C B, A G.

185
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,560
Very good, let's do one or two of these third string exercises,

186
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,640
let's do the first one,

187
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,890
number one, you ready,

188
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,990
starts on G, third string open,

189
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,420
ready play,

190
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,220
G two, now A two,

191
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,020
then three Gs one two,

192
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,440
now A, make good contact with that A,

193
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:41,140
back to G.

194
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,530
Great, let's let's go to number two,

195
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,180
throw in some eighth notes on it,

196
00:09:47,010 --> 00:10:01,560
ready, play,.

197
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,800
Okay, let's talk about the notes on the fourth string,

198
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,650
we're going to cover three more notes now in the fourth string,

199
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,600
the open string is it D,

200
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,400
now look at the music notation,

201
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,680
it's going to be underneath the staff,

202
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,050
this is our first one that's been out of our staff range,

203
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,240
the D is going to be below the staff

204
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,090
and that's fourth string open D,

205
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,290
the next note is with our second finger E

206
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,360
and the third note is with our third finger F.

207
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,780
Let's do those again,

208
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:52,910
D E and F.

209
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,510
Let's try a couple of these fourth string exercises,

210
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,710
if you look at the first one,

211
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,840
starts out with a D on a half note,

212
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,770
let's play,

213
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,070
ready go,

214
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,690
then E,

215
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,590
then F, two three four,

216
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,840
stays on that F, one two,

217
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,950
very good.

218
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,820
Let's check out number two,

219
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,930
ready play,

220
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,490
now, look at all these Fs, make sure alternate,

221
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,900
down up, down up,

222
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,460
there you go.

223
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,930
Just for fun,

224
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,570
let's check out number four at the bottom of the page,

225
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,120
little, this would gets quite intense with all the notes in there,

226
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,930
but I think you'll do it.

227
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,480
Ready, play,

228
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:10,230
quarter note here,

229
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:16,890
then back down.

230
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,380
Okay, let's try that one one more time,

231
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,010
try, it's good, it's good exercise to try say the notes too,

232
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,090
when you're playing them,

233
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,910
it helps your brain connect where they're at,

234
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,200
especially with these newer notes.

235
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,610
Ready go,

236
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:47,110
A B C D E F G,

237
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,370
now we come back down,

238
00:12:48,670 --> 00:13:00,130
G F E D C B A G F E D.

239
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,980
Now, at this stage,

240
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,820
probably some of you're, you're going to start misfiring a little bit,

241
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,580
you're going for the third string, you hit the fourth string,

242
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,130
you're going for the second string, you hit the third string,

243
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,440
that is perfectly natural, right,

244
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,270
right here in this stage of development,

245
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,650
just make sure you're bracing, you've got your bracing happening solid

246
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,840
and if you and that you go slow enough,

247
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,500
some of these exercises, I may be going faster than you're at right now,

248
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,460
just just stop the tape, practice it a little bit on your own,

249
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,180
and then you'll be ready to go, when it's time for us to play together.

250
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,410
Okay, welcome to the guitar tips, section of session three,

251
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,310
we're going to talk about,

252
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,370
what I, what I think is one of the most practical things and helpful things

253
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,520
you can do to improve yourself as a player

254
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,900
is working with a metronome,

255
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,310
metronome is a little thing like this,

256
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,970
they have also when that are the tick tock kind that go back and forth,

257
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,440
they both do the same thing,

258
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,840
it just clicks off the tempo,

259
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,010
okay, and working with a metronome is although frustrating at first,

260
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,890
is very very good for helping you settle down your time,

261
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,040
settle down your rhythm in these different exercises,

262
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,810
so let me just show you how this works.

263
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,680
I'm going to turn it on,

264
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,540
and this is clicking off,

265
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,520
let's see what does that say, 72 beats per minute,

266
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,500
and so I was playing along with it,

267
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,260
let's say, I'm playing a C chord, two three four,

268
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,020
I want to half notes,

269
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,830
quarter notes.

270
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,860
Good, see how that works,

271
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,140
it really forces you to be honest,

272
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,870
sometimes if you're sitting and practicing,

273
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,180
you know just sitting on the couch practicing,

274
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,010
you'll kind of let yourself get sloppy

275
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,470
and you won't to be real steady

276
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,810
and you'll be doing a completely unsteady,

277
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,280
a metronome will let you do that,

278
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,740
it allow, it kind of forces you to be in tempo.

279
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,540
And when it's time to speed up,

280
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,280
I raise it up a little bit,

281
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,270
let's raise it up to let's say 92,

282
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,910
I'm going to do the same thing, C chord,

283
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,260
ready, go,

284
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,990
one two three four,

285
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,070
half notes,

286
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,750
quarter notes,

287
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,570
I can switch between chords,

288
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,600
I can do single notes,

289
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,750
working with a metronome,

290
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,040
probably one of the best things you can do.

291
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,110
Next thing I want to talk about in our guitar tips is

292
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,760
holding your notes out,

293
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,350
if you have a really really long note,

294
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,840
let's say a G here on the first string

295
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,790
and I need to hold that out,

296
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,040
if I've got a tie, I'm holding into the next measure,

297
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,150
I've got a really,

298
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,370
the guitar naturally decays,

299
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,690
it's one of the instruments,

300
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,780
that doesn't really hold its, keep having to refresh the note,

301
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,810
so being that it has a very quick decay time,

302
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,310
when you play that G,

303
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,990
you really gotta keep that finger on to get the most that you can out of that note,

304
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,010
while it's playing,

305
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,090
you don't want to just play it,

306
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,930
if it's a whole note,

307
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,730
just play it and then go on to the next note,

308
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,410
you got to hold these notes out,

309
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,630
keep the pressure on through those long notes.

310
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,980
Also, now that we've introduced some new notes,

311
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,880
you'll notice that,

312
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,730
we've got two of different kinds of notes,

313
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,500
now we've got two Ds, we've got a low and a high,

314
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,330
we got two Es, a low and a high,

315
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,070
we've got two Fs,

316
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,450
and last we have two of Gs,

317
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,710
now, if you writing in notes

318
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,600
and I would encourage you to write notes, if you need to.

319
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,630
Sometimes we get into the habit

320
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,430
of just looking at the tops of the lines

321
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,660
and looking at the notes we've written in

322
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,540
and will miss whether it's a low G or high G,

323
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,800
how am I supposed to keep that straight,

324
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,240
you gotta look at the music,

325
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,340
if that note is in the staff second line,

326
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,510
that's the lower G,

327
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,130
if it's up on top of the staff,

328
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,180
on the top space,

329
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,380
then that's the upper G,

330
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,060
so you gotta make sure always be looking at the music,

331
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,370
now we're getting into these doubles of notes,

332
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,560
by the end you'll have two and three of all these notes,

333
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,180
they're called octaves,

334
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,490
so you'll have many different octaves by the time we're done.

335
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,640
Okay, now, here's your assignment for this coming, for this session,

336
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,320
the things that you need to cover,

337
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,880
I want you to do all of the first through the fourth string exercises in your book,

338
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,690
play through our songs, that I have listed out there,

339
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,710
Yankee Doodle,

340
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,900
When the Saints Go Marching In,

341
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,770
and Love me Tender.

342
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,240
Now, we'll work on those in the workshop time,

343
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,050
so I'll see you there.

344
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,810
Okay, welcome to the workshop time,

345
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,200
this is where I think the work gets done,

346
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,180
a lot of guys dream about being a guitar player,

347
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,700
but here when you're actually doing the practicing

348
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,200
is what separates dreamers from guys that actually become guitar players,

349
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,910
so let's start going through these exercises,

350
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,890
remember what we talked about last time,

351
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,260
we have ties, we have dots,

352
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,270
ties tie over the bar line

353
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,890
and you add those two notes together,

354
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,500
dots what do dots do,

355
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,230
dots add half of whatever they're attached to,

356
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,450
mainly you're going to see it attached to half notes,

357
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,850
so it would be a dot attached to a half note,

358
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,380
would actually get three beats.

359
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,840
Okay, let's start going through some of these exercises,

360
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,160
I'm gonna work with a metronome,

361
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,160
like we talked about in our guitar tips section,

362
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,670
just so you can see how working with a metronome really pays off,

363
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,020
my metronome is set to about 66 beats per minute right now

364
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,020
and let's go through third string exercises.

365
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,750
We're going to go through the first one,

366
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,530
remember our notes on the third string, G A,

367
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,730
let's play together,

368
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,100
number one, third string exercises,

369
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:21,520
ready, go.

370
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,050
To number two,

371
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,950
ready play.

372
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,020
Very good, okay, now let's do number three,

373
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:58,390
ready, play, rest, rest.

374
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,880
Number four, three four time,

375
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,500
I've switched time signatures on you,

376
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,690
it's not always going to be in four four time,

377
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,610
some songs are gonna be in three,

378
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,470
this has three beats per measure,

379
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,610
let's do this one,

380
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,210
ready play.

381
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,500
Very good, let's crank it up a little bit,

382
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,380
try that last one one more time.

383
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,320
Now, I'm at about 92

384
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,230
and maybe too fast, let's go back to 80,

385
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:49,380
number four, ready go.

386
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,780
Now let's talk about fourth string exercises,

387
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,250
remember our notes on the fourth string,

388
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,610
we have D, second finger E, the third finger F.

389
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,750
Okay, let's go through all of our notes,

390
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,790
just while I'm thinking about, D E F,

391
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,450
next note, next line G A,

392
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,890
next string, B C D,

393
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,860
E F G,

394
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,860
let's go backwards.

395
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,020
Fourth string exercise number one,

396
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:52,750
go, one two, two three four.

397
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,830
Here you go, number two,

398
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,170
ready play,

399
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:11,200
do remember to alternating your picking.

400
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,280
We'll do number three,

401
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:24,970
ready go.

402
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,250
And last one, number four,

403
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,900
ready play,

404
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,770
quarter note,

405
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:50,880
let's do it again.

406
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,490
Let me crank up the tempo a little bit,

407
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,030
and let's do that number four one more time,

408
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,470
a little bit faster,

409
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,720
this is back at 88,

410
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:11,250
one two, ready play,

411
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:22,740
do it again.

412
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,690
Very good, let's move on to our songs,

413
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,160
can I just go through some of the songs that we need to cover for next time,

414
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,290
first one is going to be Yankee Doodle,

415
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,320
okay, Yankee Doodle that was the first song I learned,

416
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,240
when I was learning guitar, there's Yankee Doodle,

417
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,130
here we go, let me flip on the metronome here,

418
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,050
I'll go to pretty nice slow events pace for this one,

419
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,050
ready, starts on that C,

420
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:56,870
ready play,

421
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,780
next line,

422
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,540
here you go, we're going to do one more time,

423
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,470
give another shot at it,

424
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:41,010
ready play.

425
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,690
Pretty good, move on the next song,

426
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,430
When the Saints Go Marching In,

427
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,830
okay, now this one starts with the rest,

428
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,660
you want to make sure that you don't play on that first rest,

429
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,590
a little bit confusing,

430
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,550
I'll count it off for you,

431
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,390
let's play together.

432
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,470
One two three four, rest,

433
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,260
two three four, rest,

434
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:18,300
two three four, rest,

435
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,800
one two one two,

436
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,120
here comes a tie,

437
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,430
hang onto it, keep that pressure down,

438
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:32,040
one two, here's a dot, two three,

439
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:47,790
two three four, one rest,

440
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,910
two three four, one two three four.

441
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,110
Very good, very good,

442
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,250
let me turn this on,

443
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,240
let's play one more time,

444
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,700
speed it up a little bit,

445
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,270
one two,

446
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,560
When the Saints Go Marching In,

447
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,140
two, ready and rest,

448
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,400
two three four, rest,

449
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:21,450
two three four, rest,

450
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:29,400
two three four, one two,

451
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:47,160
two three four, one two three four.

452
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,680
Last one we need to do is Love me Tender

453
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,660
or Aura Lee as the older name, it was called,

454
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,950
about right there.

455
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:16,890
One, two, ready, go,,

456
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,780
next line, ready, go,,

457
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:45,360
two three four, two three four.

458
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,610
Good, speed it up a little bit

459
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,510
and try it one more time.

460
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:58,290
Ready, one two, ready, play,

461
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:18,240
next line, go, this is easy [],

462
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:32,400
two three four, two three four.

463
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,310
All the practice, you can get is really going to start paying off,

464
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:40,020
as we're coming towards the end of learning these notes on the third and the fourth string.

465
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:48,250
So get ready and we will see you next time.
