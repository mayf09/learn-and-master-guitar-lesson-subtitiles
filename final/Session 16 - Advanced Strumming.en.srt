00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,740
Hi, welcome to session 16,

2
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,515
in this session, we're going to talk about advanced strumming,

3
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:35,460
going beyond the normal rhythm, rhythms that you normally play.

4
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,150
We're talk about sixteenth notes,

5
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,230
a new concept for us, strumming sixteenth notes,

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,510
as well as we're going to learn some cool rhythm techniques,

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,610
that you can incorporate into your own playing.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,170
In the guitar tips section,

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,250
we're going to talk about acoustic guitars,

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,830
different types of acoustic guitars,

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,020
steel string, nylon string, twelve string,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,120
we're going talk about some different equipment for acoustic playing,

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,830
if you use a lot of interested in using some effects with your acoustic,

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,010
pickups, processors, and how to manage feedback,

15
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,450
one of the worst things that an acoustic guitar player always finds himself in.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,220
Okay, so let's go ahead and get started.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,210
Now let's talk about sixteenth notes,

18
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,675
let's review our rhythms,

19
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:25,470
we haven't talked about rhythms and wow, a whole bunch of sessions,

20
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,190
but let's talk about them for a second,

21
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,705
because we have one more level,

22
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,020
We still need to get down into, into rhythms,

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,060
whole notes get four beats,

24
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,900
half notes get two beats.

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,770
quarter notes get one beat,

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,170
and then we split the atom there,

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,210
and we got into eighth notes,

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,580
two eighth notes equal one quarter note,

29
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,765
two eighth notes for every beat,

30
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,570
and now we're going to go down one more level,

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,710
to sixteenth notes,

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,230
so it takes four sixteenth notes to make up one beat,

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm basically splitting an eighth note now,

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,080
so now I have four sixteenth notes make up one beat,

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,860
so in a measure of 4/4 times,

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,320
there would actually be sixteen,

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,845
sixteenth notes would make up a measure in 4/4 time,

38
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:10,810
that's how you get the name,

39
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,770
wholes, halves, quarters, eighths and now sixteenth.

40
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,230
There are division subdivisions lower than that,

41
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,970
thirty seconds, sixty fourth notes,

42
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,630
but you as a guitar player,

43
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,505
probably are never gonna see anything like that,

44
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,110
I can probably count on my hand the times,

45
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,960
I've ever even seen a thirty second note,

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,480
but you will be dealing with sixteenth notes quite a bit.

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,180
Okay, so let's learn about those,

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,350
first, let's talk about it in in single notes before we get to chords,

49
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,480
okay, so let's take a look at them,

50
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,360
in your right hand, you want to make sure you're doing down up, down up,

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
you're alternating your picking.

52
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,110
So just on a C,

53
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,180
let's look at that first example there,

54
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,250
we have four quarter notes,

55
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,380
and then another measure of that, and then we go into eighth notes

56
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,270
and then sixteenth notes,

57
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,650
ready, two, three,

58
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,140
eighth notes, now, down,

59
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,220
here come those sixteenth notes.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,640
Good.

61
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,640
Now let's try it with a metronome,

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,620
two, ready go,

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,670
quarter notes first,

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,390
eighth notes,

65
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,650
sixteenth,

66
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:36,690
good.

67
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,410
Let's do exercise number three

68
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,900
and vary the notes up a little bit,

69
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,490
one, two, ready go,

70
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,790
that's a little too fast,

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,565
let's slow that down,

72
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,310
go,

73
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,430
do it again, go.

74
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,180
In sixteenth note strumming,

75
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,730
there's two different ways that we can go about it,

76
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,630
and there's two different camps of people that learn this,

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,270
so let's see if which camp you're going to be in,

78
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,690
let me play this rhythm

79
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,540
and you try and play it back to me,

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,360
okay, I'll do it just on a G chord.

81
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,340
ready, go,

82
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,430
good, now a small percentage of people can actually listen to the rhythm

83
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,800
and just go, okay, I get it

84
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,480
and they just suddenly start playing it,

85
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,250
how they do that, I don't know,

86
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,650
it's one of the great mysteries of life in,

87
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,790
but it is a it is, it is a fact,

88
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,480
that some people hear it

89
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,530
and they can just understand it and process it,

90
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,010
they don't even can tell you how they're learning it that way,

91
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,515
but it's just one of those things now for the rest of us mere mortals,

92
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:21,700
that have to learn exactly what we're trying to do with these strumming,

93
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,610
we're gonna go, I'm gonna take you through for about the next five minutes,

94
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,280
how to get up to a complex rhythm like that,

95
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,770
we're going to start way back in the basics,

96
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,620
on a G chord, we're going to start doing eighth notes.

97
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,770
Okay, so this is sixteenth note strumming exercise,

98
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,295
this is the first part of it,

99
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,470
let's just do number one,

100
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,040
we're going somewhere with all this [],

101
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,020
let's, just hang with me on this,

102
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,890
ready, go,

103
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,275
down up, down up, down up, down up,

104
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:58,360
again, down, up, down, slow it down a little bit.

105
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,765
Now let's take a look at number two,

106
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:04,480
now I threw in some sixteenth notes,

107
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,730
the key is keeping your wrist loose,

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,935
it's almost like you're flicking something off of your hand,

109
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:13,665
remember, we described that earlier, when we were doing rhythms,

110
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,740
it's like you're flicking something off of your hand,

111
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,170
number two, ready, go,

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,180
down up, down up down up, down up down up, down,

113
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,320
eighth, sixteenth.

114
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,100
Good, number three, go.

115
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,740
Got it,

116
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,080
okay, now let's put all sixteenth notes in a row,

117
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,020
so just gonna be sixteen sixteenth notes,

118
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
ready go,

119
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,910
see how that works,

120
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,010
now I want you to try an accent

121
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,640
or give a little extra emphasis the first sixteenth in every one of those four pairs,

122
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,950
okay, 4/4 sets of four,

123
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,300
in the first sixteenth notes, in each of those,

124
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,550
I want you to try an accent,

125
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,440
okay, so it'll be something like this,

126
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,115
How we note that musically is,

127
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:23,020
you'll see that little sideways V sign over that first sixteenth note,

128
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,700
that's telling you to accent it.

129
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,000
Now don't just play it louder,

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,425
make the other one softer,

131
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,140
there's only so loud that you can play,

132
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,780
okay, so make the other one softer and really bring out that first one.

133
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,320
Let's do it again, ready, go.

134
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,000
Good, keep that wrist loose,

135
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,620
hold that pick nice and steady,

136
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,200
okay, works out best to have a little bit of a flexibility in your pick,

137
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,150
not too thick of a pick when you're doing these.

138
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,330
Okay, look at strumming exercise number two there,

139
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,880
now I'm gonna put those accents in different places,

140
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,335
okay, let's do that together,

141
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:06,540
ready go,

142
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,190
so I'm doing it every other one there.

143
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

144
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,200
Now, let's look at exercise number three,

145
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,210
now I have it on the first sixteenth note and the fourth sixteenth note,

146
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,180
so I have my first up stroke accent

147
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,000
and it changes the pattern a little bit and you have to get used to it,

148
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,750
I'll do it real slow, ready, go,

149
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,340
down up, down up, down up,

150
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,010
see how that works.

151
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,450
Now for the next couple of minutes,

152
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,885
it's gonna sound really stupid

153
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:57,230
to anybody who's listening to this that's not playing guitar,

154
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,265
because when you're actually working with a guitar,

155
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:00,675
you'll know exactly what I'm talking about,

156
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:02,240
but if somebody's just walking through the room,

157
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,555
they're gonna think you're nuts,

158
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,420
as we start talking about downs and ups,

159
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,160
so just bear with this,

160
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,320
let's go to the next exercise with that.

161
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Okay, now, I've got it on the first, the fourth one

162
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,920
and then also on what is that, the seventh one as well,

163
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,400
so it would be something like this, ready, go,

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:32,400
down up, down, down up, down, down up, down, down up,

165
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,760
just keep doing it, really make the most of the accents.

166
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,550
Okay, now let's play exercise number five,

167
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,590
for this one, I'm going turn on my handy dandy metronome,

168
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,860
and he's clicking off sixteenth notes,

169
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,835
So it may sound like it's going real fast,

170
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,040
but it's actually he's gonna be clicking off sixteenth notes,

171
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,180
so we're actually a good bit slower than we than we were for the previous example,

172
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,785
because there's some tricky accents in this,

173
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:11,625
let's go through it,

174
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:19,110
one, two, ready, down up, ready, go,

175
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,530
down up, down up, down up, down up,

176
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:43,770
down up, down up, down up, down up, down up, down up,

177
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,560
okay, so nice and fast would be something like this,

178
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,080
see how that works.

179
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,930
Now, I'm going to take out the ones that we were not accenting,

180
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,810
so all I'm left with is the accented ones.

181
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,160
Okay, now here's a big concept,

182
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,260
I want you to keep your hand going,

183
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,880
even though you're not actually playing those non-accented notes,

184
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,945
so you can end up only thing you're being playing now

185
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:37,820
is the down up, down up, down, down up, down,

186
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,150
well, you may think to yourself,

187
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,780
well, I get it,

188
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,110
I can just go down, down and just play it at the right rhythm,

189
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,940
no, it won't work out, right,

190
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,390
you got to get your hand still doing sixteenth notes,

191
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,580
down up down up, down up down up,

192
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,350
for it to work okay.

193
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,890
Let's try that rhythm,

194
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,760
it would be rhythm number six,

195
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,220
all I did was take out the unaccented notes,

196
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,130
looks a little different written on paper, but it's the same rhythm,

197
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,940
okay, you ready, go,

198
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,070
see what I did there,

199
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,260
try one more time, a little bit slower,

200
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,460
two, ready go,

201
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,670
keep that hand going,

202
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,910
now in the last rhythm there,

203
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,400
it just adds a couple of sixteenth notes at the end,

204
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,140
now, I don't want you to worry too much about the rhythm,

205
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,835
Let's not look at the music for a second,

206
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,220
I want you to do the same rhythm.

207
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,960
Okay, ready, go,

208
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,375
the last rhythm adds those two sixteenth notes at the end,

209
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,280
so be something like this,

210
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,140
ready, go, now,

211
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,200
let's see if we can start it together,

212
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,470
start, go.

213
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,200
Okay, that's a little bit about sixteenth note strums,

214
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,680
now it's easy for me to explain,

215
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,805
it does take a good while if you don't feel it naturally to, to go through them,

216
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:46,540
so my advice is go slow,

217
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,850
don't get too lost in the downs and the ups,

218
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,395
okay, I know that's what you're concentrating on now,

219
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,680
once you kind of got the rhythm, get away from that

220
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,720
and just remember, keep your hand going, keep that wrist nice and loose.

221
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,140
Good strumming technique involves a couple of things,

222
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,420
keeping our wrist loose,

223
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,400
gripping our pick nice and strong

224
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,670
and having a pick that's got a little bit of flexibility in it,

225
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,860
okay, do you don't want to use a pick that's too thick.

226
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,640
Okay, look at your next exercise there

227
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,290
and let's see if we can use our new strumming pattern, sixteenth strumming pattern,

228
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,150
going through these different chords.

229
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,890
Okay, a G, Em, a C and a D,

230
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,890
starts on a G, ready go.

231
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,690
Good, now, there's some other techniques that I use,

232
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,330
when I'm playing acoustic stuff as well,

233
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,215
one of them, I don't know what to call it,

234
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,210
it's just kind of you're muting your whole all of your strings while strumming,

235
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,190
and just gonna gets a real kind of a chunk sound,

236
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,400
okay, so if I'm on a G,

237
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,165
it'd be something like this,

238
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,400
let me just demonstrate it first,

239
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,910
see what I'm doing there,

240
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,110
if I go through real slowly,

241
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,090
my hand is coming down,

242
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,790
I'm muting it with my left hand,

243
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,020
completely covering the strings,

244
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,970
so I'm hitting the strings and palm muting at the same time,

245
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,740
so as soon as I hit the strings,

246
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,030
I'm muting them,

247
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,170
I don't even have to have anything going on with my left hand,

248
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,030
I can still do it,

249
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,510
I'm coming through and I'm muting it with my palm immediately,

250
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,700
sometimes it's really helpful to get a good rhythm exercise going like that,

251
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,810
using the chunking,

252
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,980
I want to call it,

253
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,930
using that chunk in there makes you gives your rhythm, playing a little bit more excitement.

254
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,505
Okay, you also can do muting,

255
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:17,070
even doing when you're doing chords,

256
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,500
so like let's say I'm doing my power chord again,

257
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,120
so if I'm on F, I can go something like,

258
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,190
accenting the first of each,

259
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,270
let's say I don't want to really be strumming full up,

260
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,700
I can still use that mute technique,

261
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,270
here's another key,

262
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,425
if I want to strum, but I don't want to be very loud,

263
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,410
I want to be kind of quiet about my strumming,

264
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,570
notice my pick is not down like that,

265
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,800
I slowly shift it sideways,

266
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,650
I'm playing with almost the side of the pick,

267
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,165
it a little bit softer sound,

268
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:02,280
I'm still able to strum,

269
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,100
but I'm able to get a softer sound with it.

270
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,230
All right, let's talk about some different types of guitars,

271
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,590
okay, there's very couple of standard, different sizes of guitars,

272
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,920
let's talk about acoustic guitars sizes first,

273
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,340
there basically three different sizes you're going to see,

274
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,445
one of them is called a dreadnought,

275
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:22,980
think of it as small, medium and large,

276
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,150
medium, it's going to be a dreadnought size guitar,

277
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,580
this is a dreadnought guitar,

278
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,000
okay, has to do with the size of the body,

279
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,440
it's pretty much standard size,

280
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,120
you'll also see jumbo,

281
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,380
okay, that would be your big,

282
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,310
okay, slightly larger, slightly thicker in the back as well,

283
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,350
gets a little bit more bass sound,

284
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,695
still tune the same,

285
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,655
so it's not a pitch thing,

286
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,160
it's just a little bit of a fuller sound,

287
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,480
it is bigger though.

288
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,820
Okay, next one is kind of a concert size guitar,

289
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,860
which is a little bit smaller than this,

290
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,660
okay, you'll also see sometimes,

291
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,610
a cutaway in a guitar,

292
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,620
which will be, so this little part of the guitar is cutaway,

293
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,390
so you can actually get up here to the higher frets on a normal acoustic guitars.

294
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,790
Now let's talk about different types of acoustic guitar,

295
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,130
okay, here's a steel string guitar,

296
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,030
good for country stuff,

297
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,430
good for regular old rhythm playing,

298
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,310
sitting around the living room singing songs with friends,

299
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,490
steel string acoustic, it's got metal strings on it,

300
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,690
normal neck, it's about as wide as electric guitar neck, very similar to that,

301
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,330
it's a steel string, acoustic come in different sizes,

302
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,300
great guitar to have great guitar to play.

303
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,370
Okay, here I have a nylon string guitar,

304
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,730
you'll notice the body's a little bit smaller,

305
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,290
it's got nylon strings,

306
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,320
its going to get a little bit of a sweeter sound,

307
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,520
use it a lot for classical playing

308
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,070
as well as just good sweet guitar sound,

309
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,850
okay, the neck is wider than a normal steel string acoustic,

310
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,600
but it's a very pleasant guitar to have,

311
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,210
I love playing my nylon string.

312
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,420
Here's another type of steel string acoustic guitar, that you'll see quite a bit,

313
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,670
this is a twelve string guitar,

314
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,370
now normal guitar has six strings on it,

315
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,450
this one has twelve,

316
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,610
so each of the strings is basically doubled,

317
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,190
most of them with a string that's an octave above the one that you're playing,

318
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,945
so you can play it still like a normal guitar,

319
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:24,110
a G chord, a C chord, D chord,

320
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,790
the strings are so close together,

321
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,850
that you can finger it almost like a regular guitar,

322
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,360
it's a little bit wider,

323
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,470
of course, with all those strings,

324
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,570
it's a little bit tougher to play,

325
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,560
to put all those strings down,

326
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,260
but it is has a very unique and interesting sound,

327
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,475
very ringy, very melodic sort of sound,

328
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,370
with all those strings, it's also louder,

329
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,775
and physically a little bit bigger

330
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:57,745
to, to, to, to handle all of those strings.

331
00:19:57,745 --> 00:19:59,730
Okay, let's talk about a little bit of equipment,

332
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,560
that you can use with your acoustic guitar.

333
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,560
Now, there's a couple different types of pickups that folks use with acoustic guitars,

334
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,160
most often it's a piezo bridge pickup,

335
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,550
which, it's a little strip of wire

336
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,920
that is actually underneath your bridge,

337
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,910
or sometimes it's even attached to your bridge

338
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,040
and they're all just one unit,

339
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,005
it just picks up the sound there through pressure waves

340
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:22,200
that are going through the top sound board of your guitar

341
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,655
and usually comes out through your end pin here

342
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,040
and you can plug in the guitar that way,

343
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,605
sometimes you'll even see pickups that are actually electric guitar pickup,

344
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,820
that they fit inside the acoustic guitar hole,

345
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,480
those aren't quite going to get you as natural a sound as a piezo pickup.

346
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:43,800
The third way that that folks pick up guitars, electric or acoustic guitars is,

347
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,390
they have just a small condenser mic that's actually on the inside of the guitar,

348
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,730
it can get real, get a very natural sound, get a very big sound,

349
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,730
often times you have one problem with them,

350
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,020
it's a real common problem that you have with acoustic guitars, feedback,

351
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,790
if you're playing in any sort of situation that's loud

352
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,130
and there's a lot of sound around

353
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:09,530
feedback from you or from other instruments and musicians on stage,

354
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,210
will get inside of your sound hole

355
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,340
to pick up is a pick up a bridge pick up here,

356
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,700
so it's picking up anything that's vibrating the top of this guitar,

357
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,705
so if whatever's vibrating it,

358
00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:23,980
no matter whether I'm doing this or whether whether I'm playing the guitar,

359
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,080
that's all being picked up through here,

360
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,190
so once feedback starts in there,

361
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,005
it just kind of it goes through here,

362
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:32,795
out my guitar, through my amp, back into my guitar

363
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:35,710
and it just starts going and getting bigger and bigger, bigger,

364
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,650
one of the best investments you can make as an acoustic player

365
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,500
is a little plastic or rubber device here called a feedback buster

366
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,660
and there's different names for them

367
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,120
and it just fits right in your sound hole,

368
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,470
and it stops the sound from going actually inside the instrument,

369
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,810
so any outside sounds from going in your instrument,

370
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,090
so you can still play your strings,

371
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,940
and it's gonna be picked up through your bridge pickup right here,

372
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,080
but it's not gonna be as susceptible to feedback,

373
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,010
is a great device,

374
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,160
that every acoustic guitar player,

375
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,190
that's running through a band system or a sound system needs to have.

376
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,500
There are also effect units that you can get,

377
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,980
for acoustic instrument acoustic instrument processors,

378
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,570
You can in adjust your EQ,

379
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,660
you can add some reverb, maybe some chorus,

380
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,070
very helpful units

381
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,720
to try and determine to try and get a little bit more out of your acoustic playing,

382
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,430
especially if you're in a live situation.

383
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,560
Okay, your assignment for this session is like this,

384
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,260
you need to practice your sixteenth note strumming,

385
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,225
on open and with barre chords,

386
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,920
use open chords, use barre chords,

387
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,780
practice that sixteenth note strumming,

388
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,700
start off slow,

389
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,710
slowly increase your speed,

390
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,880
remember those accents,

391
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,270
how we built down all the way down to that subdivision,

392
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,760
where we left those ones out

393
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,770
and we were just left with the accented notes,

394
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,760
that's where we're going,

395
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,530
good smooth strumming.

396
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,030
Play the strumming exercises in your book,

397
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,110
also, there's plenty of exercises in the Jam Along CDs,

398
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,480
and there's extra songs in your book as well,

399
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,930
experiment with, experiment with making up your own patterns,

400
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,850
don't just do the ones I have here,

401
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,980
so I just have a handful of them down there,

402
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,300
make up your own patterns,

403
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,160
your own pattern will give yourself the unique sound that you need,

404
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,830
and it doesn't take like a whole bunch of different patterns,

405
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,860
just find a couple that suits your playing style best,

406
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,850
and that will kind of start to define your rhythm playing.

407
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,770
Okay, we got a lot of things to work out at the workshop,

408
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,640
I'll see you there.

409
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,450
Okay, welcome to the workshop,

410
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,425
we're going to talk about strumming,

411
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:50,620
let's review good strumming technique.

412
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,070
Okay, our hand, our wrist is loose,

413
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,170
but we have a firm grip on our pick.

414
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,270
Okay, well let's just do sixteenth notes,

415
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,240
I fired up my metronome here

416
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,920
and we just do sixteenth notes,

417
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,630
no accents, just straight sixteenth,

418
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,090
get used to that loose wrist,

419
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
on a G chord,

420
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,960
two, ready go,

421
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,990
slow and even,

422
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,950
Remember, we did our accents,

423
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,060
like our strumming pattern number six down there,

424
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,520
let's practice that one real quick,

425
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,760
ready go,

426
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:47,950
down up, down up.

427
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,680
Okay, now let's look at strumming exercise number one,

428
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,850
using that pattern that we just did,

429
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,285
starts off with a G,

430
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:04,370
we'll do that for four bars,

431
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,050
ready, go,

432
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,670
back to G,

433
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:45,290
down up, down up, down, down up, down up, down,

434
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,150
C, keep that hand going.

435
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,150
Okay, now let's get a little bit more complicated with our chords,

436
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,010
okay, look at exercise number two,

437
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,930
we just have two bars of E starts it,

438
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,090
let's do that same pattern,

439
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,500
slow it down a little bit,

440
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,790
and go from there,

441
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,930
ready, go,

442
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:36,550
another bar, F#m, A,

443
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,460
let's do it again, a little faster.

444
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,290
Okay, now let's look at that third exercise again,

445
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,720
okay, I added some different chords with it,

446
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,120
remember our two chords, our minor eleventh,

447
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,760
let's try it, two, ready, go,

448
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:43,970
Em7,

449
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,105
now look at that,

450
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:52,160
I just have two beats on each of those Em7 and Asus right there,

451
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,960
now, how do I do that,

452
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,910
my, my rhythm is a four beat rhythm,

453
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,070
so how would I handle that,

454
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,310
well, just just simplify it a little bit,

455
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,200
I would go maybe down,

456
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,860
you could, it doesn't really matter what you do for those two beats,

457
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,415
you do have to break that rhythm go,

458
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:09,370
you can just do two quarter notes if you want to,

459
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,370
or a couple of eighths

460
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,290
or a quarter and an eighth,

461
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,700
doesn't matter,

462
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,940
just whatever you can, as long as you break those two up,

463
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,575
and when you get back to the measures that have four in them,

464
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:20,230
you're back to your strumming pattern again.

465
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,950
Okay, let's try again one more time,

466
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,930
ready go, top,

467
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,605
see how that works for those particular two beats,

468
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:18,130
I don't necessarily have to stay with the rhythm,

469
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,410
I can do whatever I want to for those two beats.

470
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,160
There's more songs and more strumming exercises in your materials there,

471
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,170
don't forget the Jam Along CDs,

472
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,570
give you a lot of good practice on strumming,

473
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,800
relax that wrist,

474
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,020
and that will give you a good fluid strumming techniques,

475
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,900
keep up the good work as you're doing all this strumming stuff,

476
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,025
there's a lot of good material that you can cover

477
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:39,560
and it really kicks up your plan,

478
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,510
it's a little tricky to get started with,

479
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,790
but the more you do it, the easier it'll get.

480
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,870
I'll see you next time.
