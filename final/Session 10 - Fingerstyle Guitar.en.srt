00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:33,750
Hi, welcome to session 10,

2
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,630
in this session, we're gonna cover arpeggios,

3
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,860
finger picking, a little bit about fingerstyle technique,

4
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,030
what's good hand technique for finger picking,

5
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,360
I'm going to give you some simple finger patterns,

6
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,940
as well we're going to talk about Merle Travis style guitar,

7
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,560
a very popular a country style,

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,120
I'm sure you'll recognize it once we start,

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,290
getting into it,

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,900
we're going to talk a little bit about classical guitar

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,460
and the techniques that you use for that,

12
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,140
in the guitar tips section,

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,110
we're gonna cover how to get control of your playing

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,600
speed versus control,

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,020
the only way you can get speed is through control,

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,830
so we're going to talk about that,

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,700
so I hope you're ready,

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,890
let's go and started.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,430
Okay, let's talk about finger style guitar and finger picking,

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,290
we use arpeggios,

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,930
which is a new term for you, new concept for you,

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,550
all in arpeggio is,

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,700
we've done our chords, D chord,

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,140
let's say I'm doing a G chord,

25
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,600
okay, all arpeggio is,

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,290
I take notes of those chords instead of playing altogether,

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,370
I play I break them up,

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,920
it was a G chord like this,

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:56,660
so when I set it gone,

30
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:05,180
that are using arpeggios, something like,

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,870
okay, that was arpeggio is.

32
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,280
Now, in order to get good fingerstyle technique,

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,230
there's a couple things we need to always keep in mind.

34
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,760
And it all starts with some very key right-hand concepts,

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,200
we're going to be mainly dealing with this hand, for this session today,

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,830
so here's how you can start to have a good right hand position,

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,900
when you're starting fingerstyle stuff.

38
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,960
The first thing you need to have is a very relaxed hand.

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,200
Okay, so how are we gonna do that,

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,550
I want you just take your hand,

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,740
take your arm put it down to your side,

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,470
just completely relax it,

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,360
your hand normally comes to this kind of C looking shape,

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,200
okay,

45
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,950
and with that shape,

46
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,080
just like that just kind of bring that up to your guitar,

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,200
this is actually, let's say it's the zero point of your muscles,

48
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,300
there's two kinds of muscles that run in your hand,

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,200
actually three kinds,

50
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,260
but there's the two that we're going to talk about today,

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,690
the ones that run on top, when I flex those,

52
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,390
my finger goes up,

53
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,470
when I flex the ones that run underneath,

54
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,760
my finger goes in,

55
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,590
so actually the zero position is this rather C looking form right here,

56
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,180
that's where you want to start at,

57
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,570
you don't want to start at an uncomfortable stressful position

58
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,760
or you'll never get the concepts that we're going to talk about,

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
so take that relaxed hand,

60
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,420
go ahead, put it up to your strings

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,560
and I've got to just kind of adjust it a little bit to get, to get it on the strings,

62
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,270
okay, I'm gonna put my thumb,

63
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,860
just for our purposes right now,

64
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,220
I'm gonna put my thumb on the sixth string,

65
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,100
just gonna set it right there,

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,880
I'm gonna put my first finger on the third string,

67
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,980
I'm going to put my second finger on that second string,

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,900
and the third finger on that first string.

69
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:49,870
Got it,

70
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:56,530
so we're dealing with the six string the third string, the second string and the first string,

71
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,410
now as I fire my fingers,

72
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,540
think of your fingers firing like a piston,

73
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,760
as each one goes goes through its movements,

74
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,600
you want to have freedom of motion,

75
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,010
now look what I had to do,

76
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,090
I have to kind of bring my thumb forward just slightly

77
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,140
and my wrist out,

78
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,970
if you don't want your wrist back in there like this,

79
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,320
you don't want to be like that,

80
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,430
you may be tempted to do that,

81
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,800
because you think you kind of need all that pressure to do that,

82
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,530
actually the best thing to do bring that wrist out,

83
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,940
and that thumb forward slightly,

84
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,890
doesn't need to be way out of here out of [],

85
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,780
just forward a little bit slightly.

86
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,880
Okay, and now we're going to fire all four of these,

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:43,310
okay, so the thumb goes and then first finger, second finger, third finger.

88
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
Let's do that one more time,

89
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,800
thumb, first, second, third,

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,730
for our purposes,

91
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,140
we're going to name these,

92
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,840
in your, in your book, they're going to be referenced as,

93
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,600
thumb will be T, first will be 1, second will be 2, third will be 3,

94
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,460
in classical guitar technique,

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,460
they call them different, different things,

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,720
thumb would be P,

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,820
sometimes you'll see P I M A,

98
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,200
thumb is P,

99
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,720
I, index would be first finger,

100
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,040
M, middle

101
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,440
and then A would be your third finger,

102
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,730
okay, but for our purposes,

103
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,490
we're just going to have thumb 1 2 3, T 1 2 and 3.

104
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,630
Okay, here's the first finger pattern that you need to work on,

105
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,340
it starts on the open strings,

106
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,040
we're going to put our hand right up here,

107
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,840
move that thumb forward just a little bit slightly,

108
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,180
you don't want him to hit that first finger,

109
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,030
we're going to go through this real slowly,

110
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,110
this is going to sound dumb,

111
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,920
if anybody's listening over your shoulder in the room that you're listening to,

112
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,270
this is not going to make much sense to them,

113
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,770
it's just gonna sound like we're making noise,

114
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,970
but don't worry about that,

115
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,850
we're trying to get these finger concepts, okay.

116
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:51,800
Here we go,

117
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,910
so we'll do it nice and slow,

118
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,130
this is finger exercise one.

119
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,860
Open string, open string, open string, open string,

120
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,770
thumb 1 2 3,

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,860
thumb 1 2 3,

122
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,200
thumb 1 2 3,

123
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,060
okay, we don't use our pinky

124
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,240
and the secret to all of this is go slow,

125
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,220
I know you're tempted to go real fast

126
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,500
and get get to plan all the faster stuff,

127
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,560
you'll never get fast, unless it's in control,

128
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,330
control is the key for speed,

129
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,060
you want to go for control, not for speed,

130
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,800
once I get you control

131
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
and your hand doing what your brain is telling it to do,

132
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,730
then you'll get as fast as you can go,

133
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,160
but I can't get you just start playing fast,

134
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,690
you'll forever be tripping over yourself

135
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,920
and trying to get this [flow] right.

136
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
Okay, let's try one more time.

137
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,350
Ready, a bit faster,

138
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,360
thumb 1 2 3,

139
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,950
thumb 1 2 3,

140
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,840
thumb 1 2 3,

141
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,950
thumb 1 2 3,

142
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,290
all of your fingers should be coming up into your hand.

143
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,970
Now let's add some chords with it,

144
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,000
let's start on exercise 2 with a G chord,

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,470
just regular open g,

146
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
same fingers on the same strings.

147
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,690
Let's go,

148
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:33,470
T, thumb 1 2 3,

149
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,730
I know it's a lot to keep track of as we just get started,

150
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,960
but as you do it more and more,

151
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,170
you'll eventually start running on autopilot

152
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,160
and you don't have to think about it,

153
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,990
near as much as you're having to right now.

154
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,570
Let's go to a C chord,

155
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,330
now my thumb is going to switch to the fifth string,

156
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,240
these bottom three fingers still stay on the bottom three strings,

157
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,500
ready, play,,

158
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,480
thumb 1 2 3,

159
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,530
thumb 1 2 3.

160
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,210
Now I'll switch to a D chord,

161
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,870
now my thumb is going to switch down,

162
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,460
he's on the fourth string now,

163
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,490
thumb 1 2 3,

164
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,480
thumb 1 2 3,

165
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,310
each finger is firing up into that hand at the right time,

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,350
fine motor skill controls, what we're developing here.

167
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,970
Okay, we're now switching between two chords,

168
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,940
we're going to switch between a G and a C chord,

169
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,390
okay, we'll do four measures with G, four measures with C,

170
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,930
now you're jumping from the fifth string or the sixth string with your thumb

171
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,160
to the fifth string with your thumb.

172
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,570
Okay, a little bit faster now,

173
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,040
that we've had a chance to work on it.

174
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,030
Ready, go,

175
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,330
G chord,

176
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,680
C chord, fifth string on that C,

177
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,360
here you go,

178
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,270
keep that thumb front, good.

179
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,890
Okay, let's go to the next one,

180
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,280
now we're gonna switch between D and G and D and A,

181
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,150
okay, we're speeding it up a little bit more.

182
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,520
Ready go,

183
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,580
thumb 1 2 3,

184
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,810
G chord,

185
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:47,750
back to D,

186
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:53,780
A chord.

187
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,420
Very good,

188
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,290
okay, that was our first fingerstyle pattern right there,

189
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,260
thumb 1 2 3,

190
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,360
now we're going to just invert that a little bit,

191
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,170
so it's going to be thumb 3 2 1,

192
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,830
you try that, thumb 3 2 1,

193
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,450
everybody thinks they know how to move their fingers

194
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,290
until we start asking them to do a find things like this

195
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,380
and then you realize how how little you actually move your fingers this way,

196
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,450
here we go on a G chord, thumb 3 2 1,

197
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:39,350
ready, go,,

198
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:56,120
go to a C chord,, right.

199
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,140
Okay, let's go to exercise number 2 starts with a D chord,

200
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,340
we'll go a little bit faster now.

201
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:21,580
Ready go,

202
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,390
now you're finding I'm going too fast for you,

203
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,460
you may just want to press pause for a second,

204
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,700
and work on these skills for a second,

205
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,010
to get them up to the speed that we need to get them at,

206
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,870
go ahead and continue on,

207
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,440
as if we have gotten up to speed on these next ones.

208
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,910
Okay, now we've covered finger exercise 1, thumb 1 2 3,

209
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,730
finger pattern number 2, thumb 3 2 1,

210
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,480
and the last one that I use is thumb 2 1 3,

211
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,090
thumb 2 1 3.

212
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,600
Let's try that one,

213
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,350
exercise number 3, starts with a G.

214
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,110
Let's try that one, a little bit slow,

215
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,700
ready, go,

216
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,200
thumb 2 1 3,

217
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,310
thumb 2 1 3,

218
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,060
thumb 2 1 3,

219
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,820
thumb 2 1,

220
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:33,740
now, to C.

221
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,260
Very good.

222
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,480
Okay, now as you speed that up,

223
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,330
it starts to sound a little bit more like music,

224
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,210
let's say, I'm going from a D chord to maybe an A chord,

225
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:08,230
thumb 2 1 3, thumb 2 1 3, thumb 2 1 3, thumb 2 1 3,,

226
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,720
now, you get faster,

227
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,780
you're gonna want to clamp that hand down,

228
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,010
bring that wrist flat,

229
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,450
wrong thing to do,

230
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,800
you have to be controlled and relaxed in your wrist.

231
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,740
Next thing we're going to talk about is finger picking with a pick.

232
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,570
Okay, now just for a brief second,

233
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,090
we're going to talk about finger picking with a pick,

234
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,380
which is something you do a lot,

235
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,750
is if you're strumming a little bit,

236
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,550
then you want to do some fingerstyle stuff with it.

237
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,760
You put your pick of course between your thumb and your first finger like normal,

238
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,540
now that unit just kind of starts to act as one,

239
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,190
so you can still use two and three to do the picking that you need to do,

240
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,530
so if I'm going in a D chord,

241
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,940
I do my thumb and first, which are now as work as one.

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,010
Let's say, I want to do thumb 2 1 3,

243
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,870
which doesn't land as well,

244
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,450
it would then the thumb would have to cover both spots,

245
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,970
thumb 2, thumb 3,

246
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,010
see what I did there,

247
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:17,030
thumb 2, thumb 3, thumb 2, thumb 3,

248
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,980
he's just pulling double duty now,

249
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,880
that we're using a pick,

250
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:32,780
thumb 2 1 3, thumb 2 thumb 3, sorry.

251
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,640
So you can do fingerstyle stuff with your pick,

252
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,260
you just need to figure out how you're going to do that,

253
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,640
in a little bit of practice with it.

254
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,820
Okay, now we're going to talk about the Merle Travis style of picking,

255
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,950
Merle Travis was a great country guitar player,

256
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,810
for many years gone by,

257
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,120
but he really developed this whole style of picking,

258
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,010
I like to use a thumb pick,

259
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,470
this is a Fred Kelly thumb pick,

260
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,880
nothing particularly special about it,

261
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,070
there are other thumb picks as well to do it,

262
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,270
but in order to use this style,

263
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,910
it's good to have a thumb pick,

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,610
because you kind of need to angle it down a little bit different.

265
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,190
Okay, so let me just play a little bit for you using it,

266
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,190
and then I'll kind of describe what I'm doing, okay?

267
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,000
Now, that kind of a boom chick, a kind of a picking,

268
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,220
where you're hitting the bass notes and then the chord,

269
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,990
[] did that a lot,

270
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,460
it was all started with merle travis.

271
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,500
What you need to do for this technique is

272
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,790
you have to kind of angle,

273
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,460
remember I told you how you should have your hand out,

274
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,500
well, forget that on this technique,

275
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,270
you bring your hand, you put your palm,

276
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,940
this part of your palm on the backside of your string,

277
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,990
for the bass notes

278
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,460
and it kind of gets this muted sound,

279
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,400
now it's just on the top few strings, the bass strings,

280
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,740
while the ones down here, are still able to play the chord.

281
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,600
So it's a little bit tricky to get started,

282
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,340
you have to angle your hand a little bit down,

283
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,980
I'm going to give you a simple exercise to get started with it,

284
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,490
okay, we're just gonna try and get the notes first, okay.

285
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,870
Here we go, exercise one in your book.

286
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,870
Ready and go

287
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:03,310
and you're looking for the correct sound you're playing,

288
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:18,610
you want the note kind of choked off a little bit,

289
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,550
may take a little bit of practice to get that in the right spot,

290
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,410
where it's giving you the right sound,

291
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,170
now let's add a little bit of chords with it, okay,

292
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,520
so it starts out on a C chord,

293
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,660
I'm going to do my bass notes,

294
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,510
but I'm going to play the top of the C chord with these three fingers.

295
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,250
Let's see if we can do this,

296
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,690
I'll do it nice and slow,

297
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,280
this is exercise 2,

298
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,960
ready go.

299
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Okay, now you slowly build more and more complex patterns on it,

300
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,770
throw different chords into it,

301
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,570
but that's basically what's going on there,

302
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,690
takes a little bit of sitting in your room going,

303
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,530
to actually get the flow of it,

304
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,900
once you do, it's a very rewarding style to play,

305
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,520
because you're kind of accompanying yourself,

306
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,690
you've got a baseline going,

307
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,040
you've got the chords going,

308
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,780
you can also throw a melody on top,

309
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,980
so it's a very interesting and fun technique to play,

310
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,970
so I encourage you to work on it.

311
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,040
Now you'll notice I'm switching between guitar,

312
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,550
some guitars lend themselves better to a steel string guitars,

313
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,950
lend themselves better to Merle Travis stuff

314
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,300
and some of the other fingerstyle techniques, that we've talked about

315
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,340
going to talk about classical guitar a little while,

316
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,860
I had to take classical guitar in college

317
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,400
and at first I thought gosh it's the biggest waste of time,

318
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,080
it actually ended up being one of the most helpful skills that I now use as a player.

319
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,140
So we're talking about hand position, that's the first thing,

320
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,190
again relaxed, put that hand forward a little bit, okay,

321
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,810
and you want to.

322
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,890
Let me mention something a little bit about taking care of your nails,

323
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,100
on one hand, I don't have nails,

324
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,720
on my left hand, I don't have nails,

325
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,690
on my right hand, although it's not huge nails,

326
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,070
I've got a little bit of nails on this hand,

327
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,160
it helps to give you the fingerstyle right [] sound,

328
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,150
if you get to grow your nails out just a little bit,

329
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,290
you don't need to be really long,

330
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,090
just a little bit is enough

331
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,970
to get what you need to get, for a classical play.

332
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,430
The emphasis is on a good balanced hand position,

333
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,460
each finger moving like a machine.

334
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,410
Okay, one of the best studies,

335
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,780
you can get as far as studying classical stuff is

336
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,120
the right hand studies by Mario Giuliani,

337
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,490
any music store would be able to get it for you,

338
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,740
it's his classical right-hand studies

339
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,090
and all it does is takes you from a C chord to a G chord

340
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,010
in about a 120 different ways,

341
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,430
every different combination of fingers that you can use,

342
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,620
we'll go through the first couple of them

343
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,120
and that'll kind of get you started,

344
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,500
you'll kind of see what I'm talking about.

345
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:10,990
Okay, so let's start with the number one, C chord,,

346
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:42,000
second one just arpeggios those chords that we just play,,

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,640
[] them and goes several different ways

348
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,980
to give you different combinations of that,

349
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,020
so if you're interested in classical guitar playing,

350
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,300
it's a great skill for you to have in your tool kit for being able to play

351
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,630
and the Giuliani right hand studies are the best way to get started with that,

352
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,370
control is the main thing,

353
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,870
in our guitar tips section,

354
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,330
we're gonna cover getting the control you need

355
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,430
to be a fantastic fingerstyle player,

356
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,960
that I know you want to be

357
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,270
and we're going to talk about building up speed,

358
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,110
so I'll see you there.

359
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,920
Okay, welcome to the guitar tips section,

360
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,560
there's a couple of things, four key things,

361
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,640
I think will help you be the fingerstyle player that you need to become

362
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,460
and having done this for years and years and years.

363
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,650
These are four critical things,

364
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,710
that you can do to improve your fingerstyle playing

365
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,850
as you get started in it.

366
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,430
Number 1, always practice with a metronome,

367
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,190
I've got my metronome handy right here,

368
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,920
as I'm doing these studies,

369
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,970
I started off at a tempo,

370
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,080
you're tempted as you're starting to play,

371
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,670
to get real woefully on the tempo,

372
00:21:50,700 --> 00:22:10,350
a metronome forces you to play in the right tempo,,

373
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,690
then when I'm ready to go,

374
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:25,560
I speed it up a little bit.

375
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,340
Now working with a metronome is never fun,

376
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,720
it's not fun for me,

377
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,890
but I've got to do it

378
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,440
and in almost every studio situation, I've been in,

379
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,730
almost all of them, you have some sort of a metronome going,

380
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:46,600
metronomes are what the pros use to get their tempos and and fingering steady,

381
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,650
so I'd encourage you,

382
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,220
it's frustrating you bet,

383
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,810
but it's the way to go,

384
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,230
if you want to get speed and control of your finger,

385
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,110
okay, you may be the one thinking that you don't need it,

386
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,770
but, I'll tell you from someone who's done it,

387
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,940
you're going to need a metronome.

388
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,880
Number 2, for, in your fingering style technique,

389
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,850
number 2, slow down,

390
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,700
everybody always wants to go fast

391
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,740
and next thing you know they're tripping all over themselves,

392
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,370
they can't do it,

393
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,840
their hand gets tense,

394
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,960
they started slow tempo

395
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,730
and next thing you know they want to go fast,

396
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,770
they want to be Mr hotshot

397
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,630
and they don't learn the technique,

398
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,560
so my advice to you is slow down,

399
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,460
how slow,

400
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,280
as stink and slow as you need to go

401
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:48,330
to get your fingers doing what your brain is telling them to do,

402
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,060
yes, it's hard,

403
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,650
it takes a lot of thought

404
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,020
to get your fingers doing what they need to do,

405
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,180
but it's only when you do it slow,

406
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,190
that you're actually training your hand,

407
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,890
if you keep bumping your head up against the wall,

408
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,720
trying to do it fast,

409
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,220
you can do that for years

410
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,270
and never get any better,

411
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,560
when actually doing slow few minutes each day is going to get you where you want to go.

412
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,950
Always practice with a metronome,

413
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,240
slow down, number two.

414
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,550
Number three use good technique,

415
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,080
that's one of the best things I learned,

416
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,300
was getting a good right-hand technique,

417
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,100
don't have your hand way far in the back,

418
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,290
bring that thumb forward a little bit,

419
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,660
not too much, just a little bit,

420
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,370
relax that wrist,

421
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,950
as you speed up, don't tense up your hand,

422
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,030
that's going to be your hand tense,

423
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,790
you're gonna want to tense up that hand as you're getting faster and faster,

424
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,140
relax that hand,

425
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,250
your wrist needs to be slightly out,

426
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,170
you don't want to go flat with it like that,

427
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,900
not completely far out,

428
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,400
but just comfortable hand position.

429
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,290
Okay, the fourth and last thing is practice and repetition,

430
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,920
you don't get good fingerstyle technique by trying it once,

431
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,010
it's a technique that is a physical thing

432
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,930
and it just takes sheer gun wrenching repetition,

433
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,320
so sit there with a D chord and do these exercises,

434
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,010
thumb 2 1 3, thumb 1 2 3, thumb 3 2 1,

435
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,920
slow over and over and over again

436
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,070
until your mindI just melts out of your ears,

437
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,720
and then you can start doing it with your fingers start doing

438
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,340
without you having to think as much,

439
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,550
so do it for a while, then come back to it, try it again,

440
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:46,320
the whole idea is that you want to be able to start doing it fast without having to think about,

441
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,710
you maybe really lost in the thumb 1 2 3,

442
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,360
do it over and over and over and over again,

443
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,820
the repetition will start to make that second nature,

444
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,640
and it will start to going running on autopilot

445
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,710
to where you can start thinking about chords and making music.

446
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,330
Okay, so here's your assignment for this time,

447
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,830
okay, practice practice the finger exercises that we have for you in your book,

448
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,530
extra exercises in there as well,

449
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,290
for you to cover go over as many of them as you can,

450
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,670
I would encourage you to go through all of them,

451
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,140
until you can play them at the right tempo that we have prescribed for you,

452
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,640
and smoothly and evenly,

453
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,370
you can tell when you're kind of starting to get out of control,

454
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,820
you want to be able to do it at the right tempo smoothly and evenly

455
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,730
and last is practice the song Canon in D,

456
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,810
Pachelbel's Canon,

457
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,820
the very simple song,

458
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,550
I've made more money off of this song playing at weddings,

459
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,520
so I can even remember I've played it so many times,

460
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,900
it's a great song

461
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,310
and it's perfect for teaching arpeggios and fingerstyle technique,

462
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,140
so we'll see at the workshop.

463
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,060
Okay, welcome to the workshop time,

464
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,060
now here's where we get the good information

465
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,200
that we've covered into our fingers and out into music,

466
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,930
we're going to start with reviewing the basic finger patterns,

467
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,940
what are the three basic finger patterns,

468
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:14,100
thumb 1 2 3, thumb 3 2 1 and thumb 2 1 3,

469
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,510
we're going to start with the first one,

470
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,270
in your finger exercises, we're going to be number one.

471
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,200
We're just on open strings

472
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,190
and we're gonna start out,

473
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,840
I'm gonna turn on my metronome here,

474
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,890
pretty slow tempo to start us out with.

475
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:45,020
Ready, number one, go,

476
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,980
go ahead and repeated,

477
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,050
thumb out nice and front, relax that wrist,

478
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,160
each finger firing,

479
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,050
very good.

480
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,700
Okay, let's go to number two,

481
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,350
I'll keep it right at that same tempo,

482
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,240
we're gonna work on that G chord first.

483
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,760
Ready, go,,

484
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,850
go to a C chord,

485
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,470
D chord,

486
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:49,910
stay right with that click,

487
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,680
very good.

488
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,120
Let's go on to number three,

489
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,580
okay, I'm gonna maybe click this up a little bit,

490
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,630
take it a little bit faster,

491
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,100
starts out on that G,

492
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,990
thumb 1 2 3,

493
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,450
ready go,

494
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,570
thumb 1 2 3,

495
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:29,910
C chord,

496
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,280
go back to that G chord, that's repeated,

497
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,440
C chord.

498
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,460
Great, let's go to number four,

499
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,800
let me crank it up a little bit more,

500
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,360
starts at D chord,

501
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:15,080
ready play,

502
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,080
G chord,

503
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,190
A chord,

504
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,890
let's repeat it.

505
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:53,390
Great, can I also to the second pattern,

506
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,510
which is thumb 3 2 1,

507
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,910
I'll bring it back down slow for a second.

508
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,570
Let's do number one on the next page,

509
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,220
ready, go,

510
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:25,790
3 2 1, thumb 3 2 1, thumb 3 2 1,

511
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,980
a whole idea is control,

512
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,210
make your fingers do what your brain is telling them to do.

513
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,900
Good, let's do number 2, speed it up a little bit,

514
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,390
number two, two,

515
00:31:39,570 --> 00:32:04,050
ready, go,

516
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,110
great.

517
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,320
Okay, now just for fun,

518
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,670
let's crank it up quite a bit,

519
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,050
going to number two again,

520
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,750
a little bit faster,

521
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:21,230
1 2, ready, go,

522
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,310
great job.

523
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,870
Now, let's do number 3,

524
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,310
we're on the third pattern now,

525
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,050
thumb 2 1 3,

526
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,140
which for me is personally, the most that's the one I use the most.

527
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,610
Okay, let's try that,

528
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,870
starts on a G chord,

529
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,510
ready, go,

530
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,460
thumb 2 1 3, thumb 2 1,

531
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:16,920
now C chord.

532
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,190
Okay, now let's do number four,

533
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,320
I've cranked up the tempo a little bit,

534
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,300
give us a little bit more practice on it,

535
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,040
let me bring it up a little bit more even

536
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,810
and let's do number four,

537
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:35,140
1 2, ready go.

538
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:55,410
Okay, okay, let's bring it up just a little bit more,

539
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,110
try one more time,

540
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:16,290
ready go.

541
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:23,280
Good, okay, now we're Canon, Canon in D,

542
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,790
I'll try and get through as much of it as we can here,

543
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,130
but you're probably going to do a good bit of work on your own.

544
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,570
Okay, let's start,

545
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,740
it's mainly dealing with thumb 1 2 3,

546
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,360
our first fingering pattern,

547
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,920
starts on a D chord,

548
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,800
goes through a lot of the open chords that we've already talked about,

549
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,780
as well as some of the barre chords,

550
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,670
so its a real good practice on all of this.

551
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,650
Okay, let me, let me crank the tempo down, pretty far.

552
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,700
Here we go, let's try,

553
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:06,690
1 2, ready, go.

554
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,810
Okay, that's the first part of it,

555
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,440
okay, let me speed it up a little bit more, just a little bit more

556
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,500
and we'll try it a little bit faster during that first part,

557
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,420
now you also have a D with an f sharp in the base,

558
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,520
we haven't gotten to talking about those chords yet,

559
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,900
but here's the form of it,

560
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,390
it's basically a D chord

561
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,160
and you have this f sharp with your second finger down there

562
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,870
and that's what gets that F sharp there,

563
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,010
if you just follow the tablature,

564
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,880
I'll show you what to do,

565
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,920
here you go, first part again,

566
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,300
ready, go,,

567
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:13,470
slowly and evenly,

568
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:23,780
with an F sharp.

569
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,640
Good, and second part,

570
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,570
just turn this off,

571
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,450
that second part,

572
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,360
I'll just play for you

573
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,830
and you can practice on your own.

574
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,770
Okay, the second part,

575
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:45,180
you're using thumb and third to get these first couple notes,,

576
00:36:46,080 --> 00:37:05,180
it's always thumb and third,,

577
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,900
that's part two.

578
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,310
And the third part here,

579
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,230
it gets into some sixteenth notes,

580
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,740
so it's gonna take a little working on it

581
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,330
to get these sixteenth notes down,

582
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:30,610
but it goes something like this,.

583
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:53,570
Great and the last part goes something like this.

584
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,830
Great, well I look forward to see you next time,

585
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,280
you keep working on all the fingering and the fingerstyle things,

586
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,440
that we talked about a little practice will take you a long way,

587
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,490
we'll see you later.
