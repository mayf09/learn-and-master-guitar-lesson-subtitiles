00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,610
Hi, welcome to learn and master guitar session 2,

2
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,060
we're going to cover some very important concepts today,

3
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,710
that all guitars should know,

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,840
we're going to learn how to read music,

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,910
a very important skill for you to know,

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,670
as a guitarist, to be able to get the most out of your playing,

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,500
we're going to learn about the music staff,

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,930
um what some of the names of the notes are,

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,580
the rhythms and rests,

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,680
going about playing with tablature,

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,950
which is how you're going to see a lot of the guitar music that you're gonna work with,

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,890
will have music notation at the top and tablature at the bottom,

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,690
so we're gonna learn how to tie those two together

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,700
and then last we're going to learn about the notes on the first and second strings,

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,670
we're going to learn our first notes, first six notes.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,160
I look forward to it, let's go and get started.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
Okay, you're ready to learn how to read music,

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,970
so many people think reading music is just incredibly complicated,

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,500
no human could ever understand,

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,430
and certainly no adult could ever learn as an adult,

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,320
you know usually you may learn it as a kid,

22
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,860
I've been working with people of all ages for years

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,390
and I have not found that to be true.

24
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,810
Adults can pick this up as easily as kids

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,540
and I can explain it to you in just a couple of short minutes

26
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,070
of how to read music,

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,870
ready, let's go ahead and start.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,540
Music is written on a music staff,

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,100
a music staff consists of five lines and four spaces,

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,630
music staff goes across from left to right,

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,220
just like if you're reading a book,

32
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,660
the music travels along like that,

33
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,070
think of it like a timeline,

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,490
you need to divide that timeline up into equal segments

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,960
and those are called measures,

36
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,870
and you divide them by little bars called bar lines,

37
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,670
when you get to the end of a song,

38
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,810
you have a big thick bar,

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,480
there that's your double bar line at the end,

40
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,670
means you're at the end of the song.

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,850
Let's get back to those five lines and four spaces,

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,140
that's going to be real important,

43
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,890
where the note is, on the staff,

44
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,900
whether it's low or high,

45
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,170
determines whether it's a high note or a low note.

46
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,170
Okay, at the top of the part of the staff,

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,460
it's a real high note,

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,020
at the bottom part of the staff,

49
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,740
it's a low notes,

50
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,700
as you're traveling up,

51
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,200
you would be traveling up in pitch,

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,990
da da da da da da up like that.

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,570
Let's talk about the lines,

54
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,980
we're going to learn the notes on the lines,

55
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,120
like I said in the first session,

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,240
the musical alphabet goes from A to G

57
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,620
and then it just starts repeating,

58
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,030
so I can't tell you to play an M or T or V or anything like that,

59
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,820
but we can go from A to G and just keep repeating.

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,010
On the first line of our staff,

61
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,550
there's five lines on that bottom line, that's the 1st line,

62
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,040
if the note is on there, it's an E,

63
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,450
if it's on the 2nd line, it's a G,

64
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,770
the 3rd line is a B,

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,600
the 4th line is a D,

66
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,950
and the 5th line is an F,

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,400
E G B D F,

68
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,530
wait a minute, don't get confused,

69
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,860
sounds an awful like, awful lot like the names of our strings,

70
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,870
two completely different concepts,

71
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,730
use some of the same notes,

72
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,130
but two different, two completely different concepts,

73
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,150
so don't get confused,

74
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,040
the notes on the lines are E G B D and F,

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,260
well, just as letter names, they're kind of hard to remember,

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,810
so how everybody remembers them is,

77
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,190
every good boy does fine,

78
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,070
corresponding to the E G B D F,

79
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,650
every good boy does fine.

80
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,020
Okay, let's practice, see how well you remember,

81
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,530
if the note is here, what is it,

82
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,960
good, what about if it's here,

83
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,900
and what about here.

84
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,620
Learning the notes is very important,

85
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,120
we've learned the notes on the lines,

86
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,530
every good boy does fine,

87
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,640
kind of rhymes with line,

88
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,720
it's a good way to remember it,

89
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,450
now we're talking about the notes that are on the spaces,

90
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,890
in between those lines,

91
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,570
the note can also be on those spaces,

92
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,980
there's only four of those,

93
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,390
so counting up from the bottom,

94
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,500
the first one of those, the first space, that note is an F,

95
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,060
the second space an A,

96
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,500
the third space a C,

97
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,940
the fourth space an E,

98
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,950
F A C and E,

99
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,730
which conveniently spells the word face,

100
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,680
which kind of rhymes with space,

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,980
so that's a good way to remember, to keep track of both of them.

102
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,600
So let's practice the space,

103
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,390
the notes on the spaces,

104
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,580
if the note is here, what is it,

105
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,820
and what about this one, what about if it's here,

106
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,270
and lastly, what if it's here, what note is that.

107
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,150
Great, now let's mix it up a little bit,

108
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,150
we're going to mix up between lines and spaces,

109
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,680
give you a little practice on that.

110
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,420
So if the note is here, what would that be,

111
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,800
now let's switch over, what if it's here, what would that be,

112
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,770
what about this one,

113
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,090
is that on a line or a space,

114
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,440
that you need to ask yourself

115
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,380
and then you put in the right phrase that goes with that,

116
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,390
what about this one,

117
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,350
and lastly, what about this one.

118
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,060
Pretty good, got a handle on those,

119
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,390
now the notes can also be above or below the staff as well,

120
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,830
so they can be in between,

121
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,980
we've learned the notes that are on those five lines and on those four spaces,

122
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,990
but they can also be higher than that,

123
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,670
what if I want to play a note that's higher than that,

124
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,420
how does that work,

125
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,180
well, you can do that,

126
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,140
that's no problem at all,

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,980
let's count up,

128
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,030
let's go up first,

129
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,110
so let's start,

130
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,160
here's a D, 4th line,

131
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,970
and then let's go up one,

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,260
what would this one be,

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,940
well, that would be an E, that's that top space,

134
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,360
if we go up one more, we're on that top line, that would be an F,

135
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,190
now if I want to go higher than that,

136
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,800
I put my note up on top of that top staff

137
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,660
and what do you think that one would be,

138
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,220
well, let's figure it out,

139
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,130
D E F, the next one would be G,

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,530
now, if I need to go up higher than that,

141
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,380
that's no problem at all,

142
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,530
although I cant just have my note hanging up here in space,

143
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,450
I have to add a line to it,

144
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,170
so you kind of have a reference point of where it is in relationship to the other lines,

145
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,630
that little line is called a ledger line,

146
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,250
and it's very important.

147
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,460
Now let's go down,

148
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,870
let's go the other way,

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,920
we're going to start on, let's start on a G,

150
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,570
on that line,

151
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,250
now we're gonna go down one more,

152
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,220
this is the 1st space, that would be an F,

153
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,150
now we're down to the first line, E,

154
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,740
now, if I go one more underneath that,

155
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,970
what do you think that one would be,

156
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,080
now we're going in reverse,

157
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,040
it's a little bit tricky here,

158
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,230
G F E, this one would be a D,

159
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,980
and if I need to go down a little bit further,

160
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,790
if I go down one more,

161
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,980
of course I have to add my ledger line there,

162
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:55,020
this would be a C, now we're going down backwards in the in the staff.

163
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,390
Okay, so there's the names of notes,

164
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,550
that's on the line, every good boy does fine,

165
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,040
if it's on a space, F A C E,

166
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,600
if it's above or below,

167
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,700
you just have to count them up and add it from there,

168
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,110
now let's learn about rhythm.

169
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,690
Alright, let's talk about rhythm now,

170
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,010
rhythm, it tells us how long the notes are,

171
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,390
notes come in different lengths,

172
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,400
we're talking about the length of the notes now,

173
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,420
you're still with me,

174
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,570
I haven't bored you too much now on the music reading into things,

175
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,490
let's go for rhythm just for a couple of minutes

176
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,870
and then we'll get into some guitar playing,

177
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,930
the first note we need to learn about is the whole note,

178
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,250
that would be an open circle, nothing inside, no stem or anything

179
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,860
and that gets four beats,

180
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,480
whole notes get four beats,

181
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,860
I wish there was a good way,

182
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,570
you could do this other than memorizing it,

183
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,180
but I don't know, you just need to memorize it,

184
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,890
whole notes get four beats,

185
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,950
that would be four,

186
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,120
so if I'm counting,

187
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,830
it would be one two three four,

188
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,730
that would be a whole note,

189
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,420
if I was playing it,

190
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,550
it would be something like this, one two three four,

191
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,720
that would be a whole note.

192
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,570
A half note is an open circle and it has a stem on it,

193
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,690
now the stem will point either direction, either up or down,

194
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,670
it doesn't matter which way the stem points,

195
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,740
the stem can point up or down,

196
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,840
what matters is that it has a stem,

197
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
it has a stem, it's an open circle, it's a half note

198
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
and half notes, get two beats.

199
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,060
So we've talked about whole notes get four,

200
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,800
half notes get two.

201
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,810
Okay, let's talk about two more,

202
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,300
if it's a filled in circle and has a stem,

203
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,460
blackened out circles and a stem,

204
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,140
that's what's called a quarter note

205
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
and he gets one beat,

206
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,040
think of it like a whole dollar,

207
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,810
a whole note is filled with four quarters,

208
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,590
Four quarter notes, quarter note gets one beat,

209
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,480
so it takes four them to fill up a whole Dollar,

210
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,430
half notes get two beats,

211
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,000
it takes two of them to make up a whole note.

212
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,740
Now the last one we're going to talk about is an eighth note,

213
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,830
he gets a half a beat,

214
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,950
so it takes two eighth notes to make up one quarter note,

215
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,380
two quarter notes to make up one half note,

216
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,020
two half notes to make up one whole note.

217
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,200
Don't get lost in all that,

218
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,880
just a couple things you need to remember,

219
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,170
whole notes get four,

220
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,060
half notes get two,

221
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,010
quarter notes get one,

222
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,620
and eighth notes get a half a beat,

223
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,290
we'll learn more about eighth in a coming session,

224
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,820
we won't deal with eighth too much right now.

225
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,570
Now let's talk about the measures,

226
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,030
inside of those measures,

227
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,630
we have to have sound and silence,

228
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,940
sound is represented by the notes,

229
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,140
now we're going to talk about,

230
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,400
how do I want to note it,

231
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,750
if I want silence in there,

232
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,580
we're going to talk about rests,

233
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,330
with each one of the notes, that we just went through,

234
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,700
there's a corresponding rest that goes with it as well,

235
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,140
it's just a little symbol,

236
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,880
that represents not playing for a certain amount of time,

237
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,790
the first one we're going to cover is a whole rest,

238
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,400
which looks like a dash that hangs down from the line,

239
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,180
whole rest gets four beat, just like a whole note gets four beats.

240
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,770
The next one is a half rest,

241
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,180
a half rest gets two beats, just like a half note gets two beats,

242
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,250
now half rest, be careful is a dash that sticks up from the line,

243
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,910
just to confuse you,

244
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,370
there just almost look exactly the same,

245
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,720
how does everybody tell the difference,

246
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,520
well, the whole note has more beats in it, so it's heavier,

247
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,560
so it hangs down from the line,

248
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,910
that's where everybody remembers it,

249
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,920
that's how I got the music school remembering it.

250
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,820
So, you've got whole notes, whole rest, half notes, half rest,

251
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,740
next one is a quarter rest,

252
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,340
quarter rest kind of looks like an upside-down lightning bolt looking thing,

253
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,450
that's a quarter rest

254
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,920
and he's good for one beat,

255
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,650
so I want you to play for one beat, I give you a quarter note,

256
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,620
quarter rest, for if I want you to be quiet for one beat or be silent for one beat.

257
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,630
Last one is an eighth rest,

258
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,860
an eighth rest kind of looks like backwards italicized seven,

259
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,870
that's a symbol for that,

260
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,830
that's an eighth rest

261
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,860
and that would mean that you are silent for half a beat.

262
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,100
Got it?

263
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,030
Whole rests, whole notes, four beats,

264
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,360
half rest, half note, two beats,

265
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,030
quarter rests and notes, one beat,

266
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,270
eighth rest and notes a half a beat.

267
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,890
Only two more musical concepts, I need to teach you,

268
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,740
before we often run and learn in our first notes.

269
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,660
First one is the treble clef,

270
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,330
this cursive S looking thing,

271
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,580
you'll see at the beginning of every piece of music,

272
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,740
every line of piece of music that you'll be playing,

273
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,660
all that is telling you is that,

274
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,340
the music you're about to see is

275
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:45,770
written for guitar or flute or trumpet, a clarinet anything like that,

276
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,860
that's a high in pitch, that's a treble clef,

277
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,500
make sure that is on the front of every piece of music that you play

278
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,450
and generally it will be you won't need to worry about it.

279
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,060
Next one is going to be the time signature,

280
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,840
right after the clef,

281
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,830
you're going to see the time signature, it's two numbers on top of each other,

282
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,350
most of the time, it will be a four and a four

283
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,580
and that's just telling you exactly how many beats are going to be in each measure,

284
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,290
the top number is the one, that's important,

285
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,510
tells you how many beats are going to be each measure,

286
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,040
think of it as a timeline,

287
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,930
they have to divide it up into equal segments,

288
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,420
the time signature tells us what it tells you what they are.

289
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,610
Now the most common time signature that we play in here in the western world is four beats per measure,

290
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,950
you'll see a four and a four on top of it.

291
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,240
Okay, it's so common, folks just call it common time,

292
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,830
sometimes they even abbreviate the term common time to just be a C,

293
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,720
so sometimes you'll see after that treble clef,

294
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,370
sometimes you'll see a four four,

295
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,990
sometimes you'll just see a C,

296
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,910
all that means the same thing to you,

297
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,600
four beats per measure.

298
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,900
Alright, enough of all that music stuff,

299
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,280
let's get down to playing a little bit.

300
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,300
All right, at last we're down to playing,

301
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,980
now we're finally getting to the good stuff,

302
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,550
we're going to talk about the notes on the first string, that E string,

303
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,010
there's three notes on that E string,

304
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,360
okay, that we're going to learn today, E F and G,

305
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,350
here's how they look in music notation,

306
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,410
when you see the E that top space,

307
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,690
that's not just any, that's first string open,

308
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,970
which should be like this, that would b E,

309
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,080
if I put my first finger on the first fret, still that first string,

310
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,920
and play that, that's F,

311
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,910
which is the top line on your music staff,

312
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,200
every good boy does fine,

313
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,200
So we've got E, we've got F.

314
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,280
And the third one is G,

315
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,260
we come up to our third finger on the third fret, that's a G.

316
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,770
So let's play it together,

317
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:58,260
E F G,

318
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,650
one more time,

319
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,430
E F,

320
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,040
good down strokes with our pick,

321
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,390
we're bracing with our hand,

322
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,590
G, hold it out, keep that pressure on it nice and long.

323
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,970
Good, E F and G,

324
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,190
those are the notes that we're going to learn on the first string,

325
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,840
now let's do the first exercise that's in your book.

326
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,200
You'll notice, we're dealing with whole notes,

327
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,490
how many beats do whole notes get,

328
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,110
whole notes get four beats.

329
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,540
Okay, now as you're looking at that exercise,

330
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,370
you've got the music notation at the top,

331
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,980
you've also got your tablature notation at the bottom,

332
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,310
that tells you where to put your fingers

333
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,610
or which strings are being played rather and where to fret the notes,

334
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,500
okay so you get a little bit of both,

335
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,240
you get the music notation and the other

336
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,970
and I would suggest that you go ahead

337
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,140
and write in above those notes, the names of the notes,

338
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,840
because you'll learn all kinds of stuff,

339
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,360
now you'll learn how to read music and play the notes

340
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,530
and where they're out on the guitar,

341
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,260
go ahead and write in the notes, above those pitches for that first exercise,

342
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,360
I've got the first couple written in for you,

343
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,970
go ahead and take a second and write those in.

344
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,380
Okay, got it written in?

345
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,360
Here we go, let's play,

346
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,750
let me, I'll play the first couple of bars where you can kind of see how this goes,

347
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,080
we're picking with her, right hand over here,

348
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,720
we've got an E, which is open,

349
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,710
on the first string as the first note,

350
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,450
so it would be like this,

351
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,540
ready play, two, I hold it for four beats, three four,

352
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,110
and F two three four,

353
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,950
and G two three four,

354
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,970
then back to F, two three,

355
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,450
open E now two,

356
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,960
third finger G, two three four

357
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,310
and last one E two three four

358
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,210
and you've got a double line,

359
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,230
that means we're stopped.

360
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,510
Right now let's try and play that one together,

361
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,470
you're ready,

362
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,150
let's try it together,

363
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,890
ready play,

364
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,210
E two three four,

365
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,510
now f make sure your fingering good,

366
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,690
now here comes a G two three four,

367
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,680
F, keep that finger pressure on all the way through that,

368
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,820
here comes the E, two three four,

369
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,470
G, two three four,

370
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,790
E two three four.

371
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,650
Very good, you're reading music,

372
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,000
you're playing your guitar,

373
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,950
let's go to exercise number two.

374
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,210
Now we get into half notes,

375
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,430
remember half notes get two beats,

376
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,770
so we're going slightly quicker on this one,

377
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
let's play it together,

378
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,880
ready, play,

379
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,340
E, one, two,

380
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,400
now comes in F, one two,

381
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
back to E, one two,

382
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,360
G,

383
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,180
back to F,

384
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,180
G,

385
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,160
back to F, one two,

386
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,560
E, two.

387
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,250
Very good, now let's go to the next one, exercise three,

388
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,360
exercise exercise three excuse me has quarter notes,

389
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,860
now we're getting even faster,

390
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,690
whole notes get four beats,

391
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,190
half notes get two beats,

392
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,020
quarter note gets one beat,

393
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,860
here we go,

394
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,350
let's play exercise number three together.

395
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,160
Ready, starts on that E,

396
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,490
bracing our hand, got good hand position here,

397
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,980
our hands nice and open on our left hand,

398
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,170
ready, start,

399
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,600
E E, now F, G,

400
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,510
here comes a half note,

401
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:07,950
one, two, one two,

402
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,830
one two three four.

403
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,110
Let's talk about how do you stop a note,

404
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,700
if you've got an open string like this

405
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,810
and I want to stop it,

406
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,580
well, how do I stop it from ringing,

407
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,110
well, I stop at a couple different ways,

408
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,990
if I put my palm down on this end,

409
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,130
I can stop it there

410
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,800
or I can also just touch the strings with my left hand

411
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,880
and that stops it there,

412
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,680
if I'm playing, let's say G

413
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,030
and I'm fretting the note,

414
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,100
well how do I stop that note,

415
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,020
I can just let off the pressure

416
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,190
and it stops,

417
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,620
I don't need to necessarily even take my finger off the guitar,

418
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,810
I just need to let off the pressure and it comes up.

419
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,260
Let's do the last one, exercise four.

420
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,400
Here, ready,

421
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,960
starts on a G this time,

422
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,940
third finger first string,

423
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,800
ready, go,

424
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,980
one two,

425
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:09,080
down to E, one, two,

426
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,240
F, one two,

427
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,160
E,

428
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:29,610
now G, go, one, two.

429
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,060
Very good, okay, let's talk about the notes on the second string,

430
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,900
the first string, we had E F and G,

431
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,750
now on the second string, we're going to learn three notes as well,

432
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,940
on the second string, that B string,

433
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,770
if you play it open, that's gonna be B,

434
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,000
the third line up,

435
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,200
now on the second string with the first finger,

436
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,150
this one's gonna be called C,

437
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,100
now third finger on that second string is a D,

438
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,200
so we have B,

439
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,390
let's play it together,

440
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,920
C, first finger,

441
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,220
third finger, D.

442
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,050
Great, let's take a look at that first exercise,

443
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,210
it involves whole notes

444
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,300
and whole notes get what, whole notes get four beats.

445
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,890
Let's play this together,

446
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,480
ready starting on that B,

447
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,760
ready play,

448
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,270
two three four,

449
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:36,190
C, two three four,

450
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,990
D, two three four,

451
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,650
B, two three,

452
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,680
back to D now, two three four,

453
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,180
B, two three four

454
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,070
and lastly C two three four.

455
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,480
Everybody got it,

456
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,550
okay, now I'm going to skip down,

457
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,230
since we've already spent a lot of time on it,

458
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,790
let's skip the half note exercise,

459
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,170
I want you to do that on your own,

460
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,550
but just for the sake of time,

461
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,470
let's move on to number three.

462
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,410
This involves quarter notes,

463
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,640
let's play this one,

464
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,870
starts on that B again,

465
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,300
nice and slow and steady,

466
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,380
here we go.

467
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,190
Ready, play,

468
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,100
B, another B,

469
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,140
first finger, C,

470
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:35,720
there you go, D, one two,

471
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,360
[] measure, B C D,

472
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:54,090
and two three four,

473
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,140
very good.

474
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,490
Now there's the fourth exercise there too,

475
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,140
I'll leave you to do that on your own,

476
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,450
main thing as you're playing,

477
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,850
you want to make sure you're having good hand position on your left hand,

478
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,860
good hand position on your right hand

479
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,560
and that you're playing nice and steady,

480
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,240
I don't care about speed at this point,

481
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,430
as much as I do steadiness,

482
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,310
that you're able to change between the notes at the proper time without hesitating or anything like that.

483
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,300
Now let's get to playing notes on both the first and the second strings,

484
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,930
okay, now we're going to talk about all the notes that we've learned so far,

485
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,260
let's review, on the first string, we've got E F and G,

486
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,060
E, first finger F, third finger G,

487
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,860
on the second string,

488
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,830
now we've got open B, first finger C, third finger D,

489
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,950
so not only are we worried about playing these,

490
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,630
we also worried about reading them,

491
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,810
I would encourage you to go back and write in the notes,

492
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,510
if you're having trouble remembering what's a D, what's a C,

493
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,880
write those notes in above the exercises,

494
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,380
at this stage of the game,

495
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,260
you need all the help you can get in these exercises,

496
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,660
we've included a bunch of exercises,

497
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,000
for each of the set, for each of the strings,

498
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,190
you have more exercises for the first string,

499
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,590
more exercises for the second string

500
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,920
and more exercises for both of these strings together,

501
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,070
I would encourage you to play through all these exercises,

502
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,120
you need every bit of help going through these exercises,

503
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,680
that is going to pay off,

504
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,800
when we get more and more strings and more and more notes involved,

505
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,020
you're gonna, you're gonna really thank yourself,

506
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,640
that you went through these exercises,

507
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,950
so don't just go through them once and conquer them.

508
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,460
Go through them

509
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,340
and then when you come back again the next day go through them again,

510
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,120
you'll find you'll be able to do them faster and faster and faster,

511
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,170
and that's where we're going.

512
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,690
Let's talk about doing the first and second string,

513
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,510
I'm mixing and combining all of the notes,

514
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,730
you're ready, we're going to exercise number one.

515
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,660
Starts on that first string, open E,

516
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,430
we'll take it easy, this first time through,

517
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,310
ready, play,

518
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,900
E,

519
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,580
now to an F,

520
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:12,750
here comes a G, one two,

521
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,760
now it comes to B, second string,

522
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,180
first finger C,

523
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,160
D C B, comes a C,

524
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,440
half notes here, half note here,

525
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,040
here comes to C, hang onto it for, for four beats and stop.

526
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,570
Very good, let's go to the next one, exercise number two,

527
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,990
we'll go a little bit faster on this one.

528
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:58,190
Ready play,,

529
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,950
one two.

530
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,750
Very good, I know we kind of kicked it up a notch on that one,

531
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,370
try your best to keep up,

532
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,570
you can always go back and review,

533
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,270
let's skip down to number four,

534
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,020
do number three, when you practice by yourself,

535
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,460
we'll also do it in workshop time,

536
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,830
but let's do it number four right now.

537
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,820
This takes you through all the notes ascending and descending,

538
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,050
that's why I wanted to cover this one.

539
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,110
Ready play,

540
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,270
number four,

541
00:26:43,340 --> 00:27:02,960
one two, then backup to G,

542
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,520
very good.

543
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,490
Alright, let's talk about your assignment,

544
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,560
for this session two, this is our assignment.

545
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,900
What you need to do for me is the note reading exercises in the book,

546
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,560
do as many of them as you can, the more practice you get the better.

547
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:25,340
Do the first string exercises, there's also more for string exercises,

548
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,170
there's second string exercises and more second string exercises

549
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,440
and then you have both strings together, first and second string,

550
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,480
do all of those exercises.

551
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,560
Also, there's two songs I'm giving you,

552
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,480
Ode to Joy is the first one

553
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,550
and the second one is Jingle Bells,

554
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,700
make sure you can play through both of those at this point,

555
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,600
I know it's not quite the most exciting music at this point,

556
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,220
but hey you only know six notes,

557
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,080
so there's only so much we can do,

558
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,880
anyway, we'll see you next time.

559
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,290
Alright, welcome to the workshop time,

560
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,180
let's go ahead and get to work,

561
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,370
we've got a lot of notes that we've learned

562
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,440
and a lot of strings that we've covered,

563
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,020
so let's go ahead and go through some of these exercises,

564
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,280
the first exercise that I'm going to pull from are going to be the more exercises,

565
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,660
the first one we're gonna look at is the more first string exercises.

566
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,010
Okay, let's look at number one of that,

567
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,580
starts on that E, good hand position,

568
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,430
open E,

569
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,580
if you need to write in the notes,

570
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,190
try writing the notes before we get started,

571
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,090
come back to me.

572
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,030
Here we go, let's try it together,

573
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,140
ready, play E one two,

574
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,310
F,

575
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:59,850
G, two three four,.

576
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,100
And here's the G, hold it out, hold it out, hold it out,

577
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,030
now you stop.

578
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,110
Number two,

579
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:23,000
ready, go,

580
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,200
one, two, very good.

581
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,160
Number three,

582
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,420
ready play,

583
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:59,620
one two, one two, two three four.

584
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,080
Let's speed it up a little bit when we get to number four.

585
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,340
Ready play,

586
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,700
one two three four,

587
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:17,180
one, half note here,

588
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,110
one two three four,

589
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,560
E two three four.

590
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,990
Very good, last one down here is five,

591
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,150
it's a two line exercise,

592
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,830
so when you get to the end of that first line,

593
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,470
jump down and immediately start reading the second line,

594
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,550
here you go,

595
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,160
just a little bit longer than the others,

596
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,750
we'll try it a little bit faster.

597
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:52,040
One two, ready go, one two,

598
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:05,770
jump down to that next line, play,

599
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,290
one two three four, very good.

600
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,710
Okay, now we're gonna move on to more second string exercises,

601
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,240
start with that first one,

602
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,070
starts on that B,

603
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,420
get your hand position, bracing your hand, open string,

604
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,070
ready play,

605
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:41,590
one two, one two, two three four,

606
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:55,900
one two, one two, one two, one two three four.

607
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,670
Great, number two,

608
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,210
ready play,

609
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,670
one two.

610
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,300
Now for number three, we'll go a little bit faster on this one.

611
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,370
Ready, go,

612
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:35,280
one two, one two, two three four.

613
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,360
Number four,

614
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,820
ready, play,

615
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:56,090
one two, two three four, two three four.

616
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,610
Here comes number five, another two liner,

617
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,690
let's kick it up a notch,

618
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,920
let's go a little bit faster,

619
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:07,190
ready play,

620
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,580
next line, ready, go,

621
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:28,760
one two, one two three four.

622
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,830
Man, we're really cooking on that one,

623
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,310
now let's go to the both both string exercises,

624
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,950
so it's more first and second string exercises.

625
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,340
Okay, now we're gonna do more first and second string exercises

626
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,180
and go through these,

627
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,700
we're going to kick it up a little bit with the tempo

628
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,520
to make sure that you're getting it at the right speed,

629
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,810
let's start with number one.

630
00:33:49,750 --> 00:34:04,170
One two, ready go.

631
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,020
Now, if you find that we're going too fast for you,

632
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,540
as you practice these over the coming days,

633
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,880
you'll get quicker and quicker rhythm,

634
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,730
so the more practice you get, the faster you'll get rhythm.

635
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,000
Number two, now we include some of the rest there,

636
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,670
remember a quarter rest is one beat,

637
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,590
so you have to kind of count on this one,

638
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,450
we'll do a little bit slower,

639
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,640
ready play,

640
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:54,900
rest, rest, rest, rest.

641
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,550
Very good, number three,

642
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,440
right, this one, it has a half rest in,

643
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,120
half rest gets two beats,

644
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,860
ready go,

645
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:19,350
rest, rest, rest, rest, rest, one two.

646
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,570
Well, let's do one more of these,

647
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,860
this will be number four,

648
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,630
this one jumps around quite a bit,

649
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,370
maybe a little tricky at first,

650
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:40,820
ready play,

651
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:45,830
rest, at rest is tricky there on that one,

652
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,790
go through I'll let you go through the rest of the exercises there on your own,

653
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,140
because I really want to get to the song,

654
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,700
let's talk about Ode to Joy.

655
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,050
Okay, now for Ode to Joy,

656
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,570
we're combining all the elements that we've learned so far,

657
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,800
all of our notes

658
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,870
and also we're going to throw in those chords too,

659
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,520
let's work on those notes first,

660
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,400
Ode to Joy,

661
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,410
we'll go through its slow one time

662
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,730
and then we'll go through it fast.

663
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:24,230
Ready play,

664
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,150
one two,

665
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,430
next line go,

666
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,860
one two,

667
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:11,970
last line.

668
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,790
Very good, let's play one more time,

669
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,470
this time we're gonna go quite a bit faster,

670
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,360
sounds more like a song.

671
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,540
Ready play,

672
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:38,930
next line.

673
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,370
Very good,

674
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,820
now if you want to play the chords along with that,

675
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,620
remember we have our C chord,

676
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,860
we also have our G7 chord,

677
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:16,280
so at this point, if you want to just play a strum for each note,

678
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,750
that's probably pretty good,

679
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,120
not gonna talk about strumming patterns until a later time,

680
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,980
but if you want to just the chords for that,

681
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,300
let's just do,

682
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,560
I guess we can try and do the whole thing,

683
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,430
let's try,

684
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,920
ready from the top, using the chords,

685
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,960
ready, go, two three four,

686
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,740
G7,

687
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,900
C,

688
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:56,810
next line,

689
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:05,120
third line,

690
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,030
just keep playing through these,

691
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,050
if it's an open measure,

692
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,250
you just keep playing through it

693
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,740
until the chord changes, now,

694
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,320
last line,

695
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,730
here's quick chord change.

696
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,390
Very good, we have covered all kinds of things this session

697
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,250
and I hope it's been enjoyable for you

698
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,410
and we will see you next session.
