00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,320
Hi, and welcome to session 20,

2
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,040
in this session, we're gonna talk about all the chords you ever needed to know,

3
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,400
we've gone over quite a few chords up at this point,

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,770
but now we're just gonna cover a couple of little gaps that we haven't been able to hit yet.

5
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,940
So in this session, we're gonna learn about chords and inversions,

6
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,975
chords and there are abbreviations which we haven't gotten into yet,

7
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:51,790
gonna learn about alternate bass chords,

8
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,430
like a D with an F# in the bass,

9
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,015
we're gonna learn some very cool open sounded E-B kind of drone chord,

10
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:59,790
as soon as I play them, you'll recognize them,

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,630
we'll learn about diminished chords, augmented chords,

12
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,880
they'll give you forms and all of those,

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,500
as well as building unfamiliar chords,

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,490
if you don't know what a chord is,

15
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,620
we'll teach you how to build it,

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,780
and resources where you can find out new information on chord forms.

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,310
In the guitar tips section,

18
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,670
we're going to cover practicing, how to effectively practice,

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,500
the power of warming up,

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,320
and the key to playing fast,

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,930
the power of inspiration and perseverance and the keys to being a good musician.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,335
So we've got a lot to cover,

23
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:30,270
so let's go ahead and get started.

24
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,750
Okay, so let's start talking about chords,

25
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,415
and now we've learned a good bit about chords,

26
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:36,860
and here's the last little gasp of chords, that we need to learn,

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,550
before I set you off and let you loosen the real world.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,400
Okay, we've covered barre chords,

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,765
are Fs, C#m, C#m7,

30
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,930
five string, six string barre chords,

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,120
we've covered major sevens, minor sevens,

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,140
we've covered ninth chords,

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,770
a little bit about thirteenth chords as well.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,710
Okay, now we're gonna look at a couple of more things about those chords,

35
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,075
now remember, a C major triad has the notes C E and G in it,

36
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,060
a major triad, there's nothing by the chord.

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,060
Let's talk about some abbreviations,

38
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,630
if you don't see anything by a chord,

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,110
you just see a C, an F or a G,

40
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,360
that's a major triad and you're dealing with there,

41
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,340
if it's a C, it'd be a C E G,

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,750
F, F A C,

43
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,095
now, if you're dealing with a minor chord in triads,

44
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,080
well, some of the abbreviations you might see would be,

45
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,570
like a C with an m [], that would be minor,

46
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,100
or Cmin,

47
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,985
or maybe even a C with a minus sign,

48
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,730
that's kind of a Jazz way of writing it.

49
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,660
Okay, augmented chords,

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,310
sometimes you'll see Caug, aug the abbreviation for that,

51
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,290
sometimes you'll see just a plus sign,

52
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,590
the plus sign is telling you that that is an augmented chord.

53
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,920
Okay, now let's talk about diminished, diminished triads,

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,010
if I see a little zero up at the top of the chord,

55
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,680
kind of a superscript zero up there,

56
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,890
that's a diminished,

57
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,060
that's what they're trying to tell you,

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,325
sometimes you'll see it a Cdim,

59
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:11,570
but most often you'll see it with the little zero up at the top.

60
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,330
Okay, now when we get into seventh chord,

61
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,240
these abbreviations get a little bit trickier,

62
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,500
okay, a major seventh can be written Cmaj7,

63
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,590
or it can be written with a C with a triangle seventh,

64
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,820
that triangle seventh is telling you,

65
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,550
that's you're dealing with a major seventh,

66
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,330
even if it's a Cmaj9 or Cmaj13 or whatever,

67
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,810
if it has that triangle in there,

68
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,180
that's equivalent to the word major.

69
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,650
Okay, minor seventh,

70
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,370
it would be C minor seventh or Cmin7

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,640
or Cm7 or even C-7,

72
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,410
common abbreviations form.

73
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,550
For a dominant seventh chord,

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,830
that would be just a letter name and seven,

75
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,530
F7 G7 A7.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,610
Okay, for a half diminished,

77
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,940
it would be a circle with a slash through it,

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,830
okay, if diminished is a circle,

79
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,190
then half diminished would be a circle with a slash through it.

80
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,635
Okay, with ninth, eleventh and thirteenth,

81
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:10,890
you just add whatever number of notes that you need to to get up to that chord.

82
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,940
Let's do some examples,

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,920
what would a C7,

84
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,010
and then look, I've got some parentheses there and a b9,

85
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,520
so what is that telling you,

86
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,660
well, that's telling you,

87
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,380
that's a C7 chord, C E G Bb,

88
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,845
and they want the ninth in there,

89
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:25,940
but they want it flatted,

90
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,100
which would be A Db,

91
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,990
that chord would be something like this,

92
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,800
you can also do C7 #9, like that.

93
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,880
What about that other one I have done there,

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,870
I was just kind of having some fun,

95
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,470
an F-11 with a b5 b9,

96
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,060
oh my goodness, what is that,

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,790
no problem, you just figure it out one step at a time,

98
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,640
F-, so it's F Ab C,

99
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,180
it doesn't say major seven,

100
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,385
so it's an Eb in there,

101
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:53,985
so what do we have,

102
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:58,760
F Ab C Eb and then G and then Bb,

103
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,890
okay, that's the eleventh,

104
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,280
but look what we have to do,

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,495
we have to flat that fifth,

106
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:04,810
so instead of the C, it becomes a Cb,

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,360
instead of the G, it becomes a Gb,

108
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,800
so the whole chord written out would be an F Ab Cb Eb Gb and a Bb.

109
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,490
Okay, that's a little bit about abbreviations.

110
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,075
Let's talk about inversions,

111
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:19,490
this is something you'll see quite often,

112
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,970
slash is, you have, you'll have a note and then you'll have a slash and then you'll have another note,

113
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,670
well, what in the world are they talking about there,

114
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,180
the note that is underneath the slash is the note that's in the bass,

115
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,000
okay, so in our first example there,

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,300
it's a G/B,

117
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,675
so that's telling you,

118
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:39,190
they want a G chord, but they want the B as the lowest note,

119
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,650
okay, so instead of playing a G chord like this,

120
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,620
I'd have to play the B is the lowest note

121
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,890
and that would be a G with a B in the bass,

122
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,190
or you could do it like this.

123
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,575
Okay, next one would be like a D with an F# in the bass,

124
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:57,510
very common chord,

125
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,660
it's a D chord, F# is the lowest pitch,

126
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,290
so you'd have to put the F# in the bottom,

127
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,260
and a common way to do that is something like this.

128
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,730
So G with a B in the bass,

129
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,100
D with an F# in the bass,

130
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,710
would be something like that.

131
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,070
Now, sometimes the bass note is not necessarily part of the chord,

132
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,500
it's an alternate bass we call in the business,

133
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,230
okay, so you'll see like an F chord slash G,

134
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,720
well, that's an f chord with A G in the bass,

135
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,580
how I would play that is something like this,

136
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,160
here's my F chord, and then I added the G into the bass,

137
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,700
Okay, and again that diamond is telling you which root that you can use

138
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,670
and you can transpose that wherever you want it to.

139
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,930
Okay, another one is a D with an E in the bass,

140
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,420
let's do this on the fifth string,

141
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,850
wait a minute, right here,

142
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,900
we have a D triad with an E in the bass,

143
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,050
that would be a D with an E in the bass.

144
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,580
Here's some inversion chord forms that you may not be familiar with,

145
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,985
we already talked about a couple of them,

146
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,520
a D with an F# is like this,

147
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,080
and E with a G# a little bit of a stretch,

148
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,620
it was like that,

149
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,120
and open G with a B is like that,

150
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,780
what about a C a Bb chord with a C in the bass,

151
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,920
that's pretty easy chord,

152
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,880
one big barre here,

153
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,420
or you can play it up here as well.

154
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,340
Okay, now let's talk about some really cool chords,

155
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,380
that you can use and incorporate into your playing,

156
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,325
I don't have any other way to say it,

157
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,070
but they use the E and the B string

158
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,680
and they just kind of end up with this cool droning sound,

159
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,830
so guitar players can come up with these little tricks like this

160
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,360
and you end up with some very colorful chords without having to think too hard,

161
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,960
and you can use your fingers and patterns to come up with really cool chords,

162
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,820
this would be like an E5,

163
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,890
now if I take the same form

164
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,440
and I move it down to let's say C,

165
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,280
I end up with a Cmaj7,

166
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,170
if I counted all those notes up together,

167
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,570
okay, if I did it in D,

168
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,950
I end up with a D6/9,

169
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,545
now that may sound a little complex for you,

170
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:07,295
let me play it for you,

171
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:09,400
let me put a little [], little delay,

172
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,320
very common little progression that a lot of guitar players use,

173
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,610
if I take that similar pattern and run it all the way through,

174
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,500
I end up with an A2, a Bsus,

175
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,620
we already talked about a Cmaj7, D6/9, E5,

176
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,365
the last one would be maybe an F#sus right there,

177
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:46,480
that one doesn't sound too good.

178
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,740
Okay, so some of them work better than others.

179
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,320
Okay, now let's go through these F#m11 based ones,

180
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,930
okay, so F#m11 we learned is here,

181
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,890
okay, if I take this up a couple steps,

182
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,790
I end up with maybe an E2 with a G# in the bass,

183
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,010
I go up one more,

184
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,220
I end up with this really hip Am11 chord,

185
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,630
then we have a, maybe a Bmsus,

186
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,395
okay, C doesn't sound too good,

187
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:29,660
so we skip that and go to C#

188
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,870
and then Dm

189
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,090
and maybe Em,

190
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,050
so you can get a lot of good mileage out of chords like that.

191
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,940
Really gives you playing some character and some depth

192
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,095
and you don't need to understand all the theory behind it,

193
00:09:58,095 --> 00:09:59,030
even though I hope you do,

194
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,180
you can just use those patterns to come up with some really hip chords.

195
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,500
Okay, two more forms we haven't touched on yet,

196
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,270
that you're gonna see,

197
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,980
one of them is a diminished chord,

198
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,830
okay, let me give you the six string form that I use all the time,

199
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,300
this would be like a G diminished,

200
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,390
you got a barre here on this first string,

201
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,820
second finger up here, third finger down there,

202
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,220
I'm muting that fifth string,

203
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,770
okay, if I want a five string version of, a fifth string version of it,

204
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,840
this would be like A C diminished,

205
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,530
okay, inside four strings only,

206
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,380
if I want the fourth string version of it,

207
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,890
E diminished like that

208
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,440
Now here's a great thing you can do with diminished chords,

209
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,770
diminished chords involve the same relationship between the notes,

210
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,280
C Eb and Gb and an A or Bbb

211
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,140
are all the same distance from each other,

212
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,990
so it allows you to do some pretty cool things on guitar,

213
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,330
if the cord is like a G diminished,

214
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,590
I could do something like this,

215
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,000
I can just keep building on those,

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,260
who can get a lot of good mileage out of your diminished towards using them that way,

217
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,140
you can also substitute them for,

218
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,800
like a dominant seventh with a b9,

219
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,375
okay, so if I have a C7(b9),

220
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,700
I can substitute an E diminished in there,

221
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,130
and that's just another little trick for you,

222
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,510
you can grab that if you want to.

223
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,050
Augmented chords, okay, involve raising that fifth up,

224
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,620
six string version that I use this like here,

225
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,780
fifth string version would be something like this.

226
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,120
Those are just some common forms that we use.

227
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,570
Folks come to me all the time

228
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,570
and they think, wow, you know, [] different forms,

229
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,700
well, I really don't know all that many,

230
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,115
I have what I have shown to you over these last twenty sessions

231
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:56,360
is a good eighty, ninety percent of the chords I'll ever use,

232
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,900
I wish when I was growing up,

233
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,330
somebody would show it, would have shown me,

234
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,350
here's all the chords that I use in my guitar playing lifetime or the majority of them

235
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,380
and I could grab them.

236
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,680
So yes, there is a few, but write them down in a notebook,

237
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,810
and learn them have underneath your fingers,

238
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,300
that's one of the things that's been a constant advantage for me,

239
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,760
just knowing a few more chords than the guy sitting next to me.

240
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,490
Okay, and it doesn't take many before folks think you're a guitar chord genius,

241
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,395
just you know all that means is,

242
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:22,350
you know, two more chords than a guy sitting next to you.

243
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,120
Okay.

244
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,290
When in doubt,

245
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,820
you don't know what the chord is,

246
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,600
build it, that's why we've done all this chord spelling exercises.

247
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,300
Okay, a chord is just a combination of notes,

248
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,630
all you have to do is get those three or four notes together

249
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,800
and you have a chord,

250
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,660
or you can also go into your Mel Bay's Guitar Bible big chord dictionary,

251
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,485
those are mildly helpful,

252
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:46,815
a lot of times, it's just the same twenty chords done in in a bunch of different keys

253
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,150
and they make a big, real thick book

254
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,670
and make you pay a bunch of money for them,

255
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,180
but sometimes if you need a quick chord fast,

256
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,945
you can look it up there,

257
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,930
you can always go online and look up chords as well.

258
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,810
Okay, now one more thing I want to talk about in our guitar tip section here is practicing,

259
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,960
practicing is something you're gonna be doing all of your life,

260
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,855
and it's something that we can practice in a smart way,

261
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,200
or we can just noodle around and waste a bunch of time,

262
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,770
and never get what we want to get done,

263
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,690
you always want to practice,

264
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,920
here's some practice keys,

265
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,750
practice with a purpose in mind,

266
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,740
practice, I I play guitar for a living,

267
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,810
when I have to practice something,

268
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,325
I practice it to learn that one particular part,

269
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:26,910
I don't go through the whole song versus choruses,

270
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,250
all that sort of stuff to get to that tricky guitar part,

271
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,870
that's not what helps me,

272
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,170
I go right to the tricky guitar part that I need to figure out

273
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,515
and I practice it,

274
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:35,420
you go slow,

275
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,830
how slow do you need to go,

276
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,900
you need to go as slow as you possibly can,

277
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,330
to get it right

278
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,300
and then slowly increase your speed,

279
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,950
so the first thing of practicing,

280
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,480
is go slow in practice with a purpose.

281
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,280
Next thing you want to do is

282
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,140
always practice a little bit each day,

283
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,665
guitar playing is not like some other hobbies or crafts,

284
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:56,910
it's something that you have to keep up,

285
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,520
there's a lot of physical things that we do

286
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,530
need to practice a little bit each day,

287
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,200
what's enough,

288
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,850
well, I don't know,

289
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,110
if you can spend twenty minutes, five out of seven days of the week with your guitar,

290
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,790
you're making good progress,

291
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,290
okay, I hear about these guys that,

292
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,595
oh yeah, when I was a teenager,

293
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,730
I spent eight, nine hours with my guitar,

294
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,830
well, great, that's fabulous,

295
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,840
for me, if I can grab 15, 20 minutes,

296
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,670
I think it's a success,

297
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,170
so see if you can grab, set aside some time to do that,

298
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,125
a little bit each day,

299
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,600
and you'll get some good progress done.

300
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,560
Okay.

301
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,360
There is no substitute for diligent practice,

302
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,580
just go after it a little bit,

303
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,540
is it fun,

304
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,880
no, I do it for a living and it's never fun,

305
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,455
so get over that,

306
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:40,450
it wasn't fun when I was a kid and it's not fun,

307
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,280
now, it's something that you have to do,

308
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,940
like lifting weights, to get where you want to be is the practicing.

309
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,720
Okay, let me tell you another secret,

310
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,230
it's the power of warming up,

311
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,705
and most musicians, we're in a hurry and we're lazy,

312
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,580
and we never get around to actually playing a few minutes

313
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,375
before we're actually supposed to get up and play,

314
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,660
whether you're playing at church or whether you're playing with friends or something like that,

315
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,790
it's a good idea to get a few minutes of practicing in before you play,

316
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,350
here's what I do when I warm up,

317
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,890
I usually go through a major scale,

318
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,710
I set my metronome on 60

319
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,070
and I just do sixteenth notes through a major major scale,

320
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,940
be something like this,

321
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,480
then I go to the next form

322
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,410
and I keep going through all of that form,

323
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,410
all the way up the entire neck of the instrument,

324
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,000
and then I go back down again.

325
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,805
Okay, I can get through that as I slowly,

326
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:43,795
and then I come all the way down,

327
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,960
then I crank my metronome up a click

328
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,700
and that gets me to like 64,

329
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,170
and then I do it again,

330
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,830
and usually by about twenty minutes,

331
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,140
I'm usually around 120 or so, when I'm able to do sixteenth notes at 120,

332
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,020
now that I've found, I found that,

333
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,980
if I don't do the slower steps and I skip those,

334
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,080
then I just don't get to where I could have gotten had I taken the time to go through it slow,

335
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,790
it's kind of like lifting weights,

336
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,365
you don't just walk into the gym and throw up your highest weight

337
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:11,535
and expect to bench press it

338
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:12,980
and you gotta work your way up to it,

339
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,910
musicians are athletes of small muscles

340
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,320
and so a lot of what we do is physical,

341
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,540
so a good time warming up is well worth it.

342
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,575
You can do major scales, you can do panatonic scales,

343
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,100
basically, it's just getting your blood flowing

344
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,290
and getting your fingers used to firing together.

345
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,330
Okay, you can do a chromatic scale,

346
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,150
here's a good example of a chromatic scale,

347
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,370
starting at the fifth fret on this A

348
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,000
and I slide down to the next string,

349
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,000
back of fret, next string,

350
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,070
back of fret,

351
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,980
now here I stay

352
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,770
and I go back of fret

353
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,940
and there A again,

354
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,860
good finger exercise to get you doing,

355
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,200
remember our finger exercises like this,

356
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,580
all these things are good to warm up on.

357
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,640
Okay, now let me share with you the key to playing fast,

358
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,520
we'd make a million dollars,

359
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,360
if I could tell you the key to playing fast is in some little trick,

360
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,210
I've been playing all my life,

361
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,670
here's the only trick I have found to playing fast,

362
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,740
despite all the books and videos that I've gotten,

363
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,470
the key to playing fast is slow down,

364
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,020
If I'm trying to play a lick super fast,

365
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,000
here's two ways I can do it,

366
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,550
if I just start,

367
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,150
here's what the average person does,

368
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,580
They take the look, let's say I'm gonna do the pentatonic scale,

369
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,200
and they just play it as fast as they can

370
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,520
and they do something like that

371
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,125
and they just kind of fake there and fluff their way through it,

372
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,120
and they think they're playing fast,

373
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,280
okay, that's not real effective,

374
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,750
here's what I found,

375
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,580
actually get some improvement in playing fast,

376
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,400
go slow until you can actually play it,

377
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,590
you're playing every note,

378
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,700
everything's in control,

379
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,155
you do it again,

380
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:05,810
you slowly kick up your metronome,

381
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,070
you slowly do it again,

382
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,270
slowly do it again,

383
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,835
eventually you'll get up high enough to where you're actually playing it fast,

384
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:12,750
but you're in control,

385
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,870
and that's the key to playing fast,

386
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,050
What is a way,

387
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,700
a humongous waste of your time as a player is to just keep hitting that wall,

388
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,160
oh, wait a minute I can do it better,

389
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,760
wait a minute, and just keep hitting that wall,

390
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,750
if I did five minutes of starting slow,

391
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,730
that's worth thirty minutes of me sitting there in my bed, hitting the wall every time

392
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,860
and, and trying to do that,

393
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,780
I hope that makes some sense to you,

394
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,525
your fingers will only do what you've trained them to do,

395
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:44,930
a wonderful quote by a fantastic guitarist, Chris Proctor, classical guitarist,

396
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,570
as he said,

397
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,140
in your head is every musical idea you've ever heard,

398
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,870
but your fingers will only do what they've been trained to do,

399
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,620
and that is so true,

400
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,520
if you want to be able to play those hot licks,

401
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,190
it's not just gonna come to you in the heat of battle,

402
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,010
you've got to go through and pay your dues

403
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,550
and do all these exercises

404
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,740
to get them underneath your fingers,

405
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,450
okay, that brings me to the last point of

406
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,630
being a good musician in practicing

407
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,410
the power of inspiration and perseverance,

408
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,260
if you're an average player,

409
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,880
you kind of get sick of hearing yourself for a while

410
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,690
and you go through seasons,

411
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,740
if I play a little bit better,

412
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,470
then I play don't play quite as well

413
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,520
and I'm not too interested in my playing,

414
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,000
if you find yourself in a dry season of playing,

415
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,130
you need to get inspired, buddy,

416
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,510
go down, buy yourself a CD, go out here some musicians,

417
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,900
and take an evening and go do that,

418
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,050
get some inspiration back into your musical mind,

419
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,250
that will help you,

420
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,630
go the distance and get some new ideas,

421
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,550
you know I've heard a quote that,

422
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,855
a fool just keeps doing the same thing over and over

423
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:45,360
and expects different results to happen,

424
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,830
if you want new things to happen when you're playing,

425
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,470
get some new ideas, new inspiration,

426
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,360
that's one thing get inspired,

427
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,060
watch some other players figure out what they're doing,

428
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,060
go up and ask them,

429
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,110
what gear are you using,

430
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,120
what are you playing there,

431
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,100
the other thing that I found that makes a difference,

432
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,395
and this is from someone who's played all of his life,

433
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:05,520
is perseverance, You need to keep doing it,

434
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,285
you need to keep doing it and work hard at it,

435
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:10,430
it's not just gonna come by watching a video series,

436
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,315
I wish it would,

437
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:12,880
I'd be a very rich man, if it would,

438
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:13,975
but it's not,

439
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:15,805
it comes by working hard at it,

440
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:18,550
a lot of these concepts we've given you take a lot of time,

441
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,860
it's easy for me to explain,

442
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,720
but it takes a lot of time for you to understand,

443
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,290
so I just encourage you,

444
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,430
persevere in it and you'll be able to get to the results that you're acting,

445
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,940
that you're wanting to get out of your own playing.

446
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,020
Okay, here's some last minute keys to being a good musician,

447
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,760
when you're in a band situation,

448
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,310
work to compliment what the other people are doing,

449
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,315
don't just play, don't just copy what they're doing,

450
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:40,970
if the piano player playing chords

451
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,365
and you got a keyboard player playing chords,

452
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:46,790
the last thing we need you as a as a guitar player is to be chunking out the chords too,

453
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,095
that's adding nothing to the band mix,

454
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,140
if you already have a keyboard player that is doing that,

455
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,500
you need to think of something interesting,

456
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,905
that compliments what they're doing,

457
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:04,340
if they're just chunking off the chords,

458
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,480
maybe you could do something,

459
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,830
and again, it doesn't have to be complex,

460
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,690
but you could do something like,

461
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,610
now, [], I have a really hooky little guitar part,

462
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,225
I'm not playing anything complex,

463
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:22,430
I'm using a couple of different notes,

464
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,570
so it's not hard,

465
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,930
it's just playing something [hooky],

466
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,900
and I'm listening to the other musicians around this,

467
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,920
that's your big key.

468
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,200
Okay, if everyone is playing high,

469
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,630
the last thing they need me doing is up there high with them,

470
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,080
then it just becomes this big garbled mess,

471
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,730
if they're high, I go low,

472
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,830
if they're low, I get I go to the higher [register],

473
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,000
If everybody's playing busy, I simplify and do something like that,

474
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,070
if everybody has open spaces, then I might get a little busier,

475
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,500
give it a little bit of a beat happening.

476
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,390
Okay, those are some secrets to coming up with good guitar parts,

477
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,100
that separates you from other players,

478
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,870
get out of your own playing,

479
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,640
don't just think when you're in a band situation,

480
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,225
it's all about me

481
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:08,510
and I'm so all concerned about these chords that I'm doing and stuff like that,

482
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,090
listen to what's going on around you,

483
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,060
that's what's going to make

484
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,530
give you the creative ideas to be able to make some good music

485
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,145
and remember the purpose and you're playing,

486
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:17,735
you want to play with a purpose,

487
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:19,100
I don't wanna just play just for fun,

488
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,650
even though it is a blast to play,

489
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,805
but play to get enjoyment out of your life

490
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:24,670
and also to enrich the lives of others.

491
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,510
Okay, here's your assignment for this week,

492
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,925
I want you to practice the alternate base chords and the chord progressions

493
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,640
that we have in the back of your book,

494
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,585
okay, those chord exercises are real helpful,

495
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:39,700
and you can get a lot of good working out of these chord forms underneath your fingers,

496
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,020
if you do them,

497
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,820
the idea is to be able to get them fast,

498
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,040
where you can grab them immediately,

499
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,110
that's where you're gonna get some good mileage out of these chords,

500
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,500
practice the open E\B kind of droning chords, like this,

501
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,740
play around with this very common sound,

502
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,440
these days everybody's using it,

503
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,305
mess around with it,

504
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:02,250
see if you can come up with some own progressions of your own,

505
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,260
that can lead you into some creative territory.

506
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,670
I also want you to learn these new chord forms,

507
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,550
we talked about diminished, augmented,

508
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,050
get a few of those underneath your fingers,

509
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,415
I don't know a ton of augmented or diminished chords,

510
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:14,010
I know one on each string,

511
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,880
I know three, yet,

512
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,940
you can, you'll be amazed how much you can impress people,

513
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,280
if you just know a couple of chords like that.

514
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,975
It's been an honor and a privilege being able to teach you,

515
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:26,830
and I hope that some of the concepts and ideas that I have been able to share,

516
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,480
really sink down deep into your playing

517
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,090
and will change the way you play for the rest of your life,

518
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,080
we'll see you.

519
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,070
Okay, welcome to the workshop,

520
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,625
we covered an awful lot of ground with our various chord forms that we learned,

521
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,040
the alternate bass chord forms,

522
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,510
let's just review a couple of those,

523
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,565
what is a D with an F# in the bass,

524
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:51,390
remember that, slash is telling you the note underneath the slash is what note is in the bass,

525
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,670
it's not two chords you're playing,

526
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,400
it's one chord with a certain note in the bass,

527
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,410
so a D with an F# in the bass,

528
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,640
remember that chord form,

529
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,600
what about an E with a G# in the bass,

530
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,220
what about a B, or excuse me, a G chord with a B in the bass.

531
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,755
Okay, so let's do a little chord progression,

532
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:21,030
let's say, let's do a G to a D with an F# in the bass

533
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,720
to maybe an Em7, to a Dsus,

534
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,890
okay, so let be something like this,

535
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,920
one two, G, go,

536
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:39,650
D with an F# in the bass, Em, Dsus,

537
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:49,010
one more time, G, D with an F# in the,

538
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:07,550
maybe we could go to a C, maybe C2, G with B in the bass,

539
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,800
C2, G with the B in the bass,

540
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:21,680
Dsus, maybe a D, D with F#, G.

541
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,900
Great, see how all those chords work together,

542
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,250
let's cover a couple of more,

543
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,730
remember our diminished forms that we talked about,

544
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,980
how do you do a diminished form on the sixth string on,

545
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,200
let's say a Bb,

546
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,510
What if you saw Bb diminished, where would you go,

547
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,880
well, here's the form

548
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,810
and I just here's my root, I go up to Bb

549
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,420
and there's my Bb diminished,

550
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,300
what if I wanted it on the fifth string form,

551
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,860
and I wanted an E diminished,

552
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,650
well, no problem, that be here,

553
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,860
fourth string here,

554
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,400
six string here,

555
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,560
remember repeats every step and a half,

556
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,690
so this is an E diminished,

557
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,310
this is an E diminished,

558
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,105
this is an E diminished,

559
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:11,080
they're all E diminished,

560
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,380
because all of the scale tones very conveniently,

561
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,345
or all the same distance from each other,

562
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,220
so we can move them around.

563
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Augmented chords. Let's cover a couple of those,

564
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,570
remember our F augmented that we touched on,

565
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,070
okay, remember our C augmented,

566
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,785
okay, let's do a little exercise,

567
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:31,680
let's do like a Cm9,

568
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,500
to maybe an Fm, to a G augmented,

569
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,500
okay, one, two, Cm9, go,

570
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,320
Fm7, G+7.

571
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,920
Great, okay, now adding these chords to your chord vocabulary

572
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,680
will help you go a long way into,

573
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,930
just being creative in what you wanna do,

574
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,290
it's been a wonderful series,

575
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,600
that we've been able to go through,

576
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,640
I would encourage you to keep up this good work

577
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,365
and always strive to keep hitting the high notes

578
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:25,720
and keep striving for new things.

579
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,870
We'll see you.
