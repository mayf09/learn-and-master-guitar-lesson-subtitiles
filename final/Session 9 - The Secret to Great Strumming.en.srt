00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:25,360
Welcome to session nine,

2
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,100
we're gonna talk about strumming today,

3
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,380
many good aspects about strumming,

4
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,000
different ways to get the best sound out of your strums that you can,

5
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,700
pretty much we've just been doing single chords at this point

6
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,850
or single strums when it comes to chords,

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,410
now we're going a little bit more complicated,

8
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,760
start making a little more music with it.

9
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,920
So we talk about good strumming technique,

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,680
I'm going to teach you a couple of simple strumming patterns,

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,050
that you can incorporate into your own playing

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,770
and we're going to talk about getting creative with strumming,

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,930
getting beyond just the techniques of it

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,810
and starting to get a feel for it just inside of you.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,320
In the how music works section,

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,270
we're gonna cover intervals,

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,490
intervals that are in the major scale,

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,410
and intervals that are not in the major scale

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,480
and messing around with those intervals a little bit,

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,370
so we're going to learn some more songs

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,920
and put all that we've learned together to make some music,

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,940
I hope you're ready to go,

23
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,600
I'll see you there.

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,480
Okay, let's talk about strumming,

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,220
now up to this point,

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,560
you've pretty much played one chord or one strum for each beat

27
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,370
or sometimes we'll just give a whole note for each measure that chord is in,

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,890
we're going to talk about strumming, what strumming,

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,010
strumming is playing a rhythm while playing the chords,

30
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,900
so instead of just playing a G down here,

31
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,740
we're gonna add a little rhythm to it.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,090
By the end of this session,

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,290
you'll be able to do that,

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,840
because that's one of our simple rhythmic patterns,

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,820
that we're going to be talking about simple strumming patterns.

36
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,710
Okay, so just adding some simple strumming your chord playing

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,120
helps you to start making music

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,110
and that's what it's all about.

39
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,630
Okay, so let's first start talking about technique,

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,250
in our right hand, not much that needs to happen,

41
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,590
but a couple key things you need, you need to think about,

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,650
you need to hold your pick, nice and firm,

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,050
okay, you need to have,

44
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,900
because when you're strumming, you don't want that pick to be too loose,

45
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,240
when you get a whole awful lot of pick noise,

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,830
which is not a good sound,

47
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,660
need to hold that pick nice and strong,

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,230
you want your wrist to be loose,

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,850
a lot of times folks will think,

50
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,800
as we're getting through some of these exercises

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,690
as you speed up the tendency is to really tense up that, tense up that hand

52
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,750
to where you if you bring this wrist in

53
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,880
and you tense up this whole forearm up here,

54
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,430
okay, you gotta get faster and you get all excited about that

55
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,600
and you get all tensed up

56
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,400
and that's not what we want to do,

57
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,560
the motion is not that,

58
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,950
the motion is more like you're flicking something off of your hand,

59
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,910
imagine if you had something on your hand,

60
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,650
and you were trying to flick something off of it,

61
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,940
that's the motion,

62
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,770
your wrist is loose,

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,180
you have to still hold your pick,

64
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,430
but your wrist is loose as you're doing that,

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,010
okay, you want your arm motion,

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,390
let's talk about what your arm is doing,

67
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,760
your arm is like, think of it like a piston on in a in an engine,

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,650
it's always going to be going down up, down up, down up, down up,

69
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,060
in some of these examples,

70
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,120
I'll be I'll be telling you different combinations,

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,680
whatever combination I tell you,

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,340
it's always going to fit into the pattern of down up, down up, down up, down up,

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,210
I'm never going to, I'm going to tell you do a up, when you're in the cycle to do a down,

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,470
in vice versa,

75
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,310
now that may seem like you really have to think about it a lot,

76
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,000
as you get into it and speed it up a little bit,

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
you realize there's no other way to do it,

78
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,580
then being consistent with the downs and the ups,

79
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,990
so your hand is always gone,

80
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,550
even if I just tell you to do three or four quarter notes,

81
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:08,130
four quarter notes on a G, down down down down,

82
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,580
there's still a silent up that you're doing,

83
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,590
if you'll notice what your hand is doing.

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,390
Now we're going to start talking about making those UPS into strums

85
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,130
and getting a little more complex with that.

86
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,190
Okay, so you're ready for the secret of great strumming,

87
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,140
here's the secret right here,

88
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,470
I'll say it probably a dozen times during the course of this,

89
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,410
KEEP YOUR HAND GOING,

90
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,380
the temptation would be to stop, make it stop,

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,870
and that's gonna make you sound choppy and uneven,

92
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,710
it's not going to work,

93
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,850
what's the secret,

94
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,760
keep your hand going,

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,200
keep your hand going,

96
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:56,240
I could play that rhythm like this,

97
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,810
it doesn't sound right,

98
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,830
it kind of sounds choppy,

99
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,270
I kind of lose some of the rhythm with it,

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,950
what's the secret,

101
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,360
keep your hand going.

102
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,010
Okay, now let's take a look at some simple strumming patterns,

103
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,300
we're going to start very basic

104
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,930
and then get to some more complicated patterns that sounds a bit more musical.

105
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,920
Okay, so look at example number one,

106
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,060
just on a C chord,

107
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,840
we're just gonna do down strokes on that C chord

108
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,500
and then we're going to get into eighth notes and down and up,

109
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,690
what you're looking for here is,

110
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,660
I'm hitting accurate going down on that C chord,

111
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,090
I hit that fifth string down

112
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,570
when I, when my hand and arm kind of arc back,

113
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,060
I hit a few other strings,

114
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,140
not all of them,

115
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,190
remember we talked about that,

116
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,010
so accurate going down, some of them coming out of,

117
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,380
my hand is always making this little arc right here,

118
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,480
my hand is always going down up down up

119
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,660
and you're looking for smooth even strumming.

120
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,930
Here we go, number one, ready go,

121
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,430
another measure,

122
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,550
now the eighth notes here,

123
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:18,210
down up, down up, down up, smoothing even,

124
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,340
let's go back to those quarters repeat,

125
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,710
down down down down down,

126
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,570
I'll slow it down a little bit here,

127
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,030
eighth notes, ready go.

128
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,930
Very good, okay,

129
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,120
now let's go to look at number two,

130
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,950
now I kind of bring those eighth notes

131
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,820
and I mix them in with a with a quarter notes a little bit more,

132
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,210
okay, we're gonna go from a C chord to a G chord,

133
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,580
I'll start slow

134
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,900
and then we'll play a little bit faster.

135
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,190
Number two, ready, go,

136
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,030
C, C, down up, down up,

137
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,970
G, G, down up,

138
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,640
repeat it back to C,

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,640
smooth and even strums.

140
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,060
Very good, number three,

141
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,140
let's take a look at number three,

142
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,910
through some barre chords in here for you,

143
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,400
just give a little practice on barre chords,

144
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,410
because you can strum on barre chords as well,

145
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,890
I've mixed the rhythm up a little bit more,

146
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,330
now when you see those slashes,

147
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,150
that means you're just supposed to keep on with that same rhythm, remember,

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,750
ready, start on an F chord,

149
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,910
ready, go,

150
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,740
down, down up, down, down up,

151
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,170
Bb,

152
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,160
Gm7,

153
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,630
Csus,

154
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,540
F,

155
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,620
let's try that one more time,

156
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,120
a little bit faster this time,

157
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,680
ready, go.

158
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,560
Good, now you'll notice,

159
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,240
I used different barre chords,

160
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,830
for that, you want generally it's easiest to play barre chords,

161
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,370
yeah, from about maybe the eighth fret down,

162
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,330
so if I come,

163
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,190
like in that example, I have a Csus at the very next to last measure,

164
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,420
now I have a choice,

165
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,540
whether to play a Csus up here or down here,

166
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,400
generally, things are more comfortable down here,

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,650
so I'm always swapping those forms

168
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,190
at which form would put me in a more favorable position to play.

169
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,530
Okay, now we've done strumming with just eighth notes,

170
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,420
keeping track of our downs and our ups,

171
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,280
now we're going to throw a few ties in it

172
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,540
and it makes it a little bit more musically interesting to listen to.

173
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,070
Okay, so let's start with number one,

174
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,040
this is strumming with eighth notes and ties.

175
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,530
Okay, let's look at number one in your book,

176
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,090
starts on a G chord

177
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,380
and look at that pattern, down, down up, up, down,

178
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,390
now don't get to lost in the downs and ups,

179
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,300
remember your hand is always going down up, down up, down up, down up,

180
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,390
so now I'm just going to take out some of those downs, some of those ups,

181
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,920
and we're just going to play the ones that we need to,

182
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,610
down, down up, up, down,

183
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,060
let me slow it down, down, down up, up, down,

184
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,230
remember your hand is always going down up, down up, down,

185
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,460
now on a G chord.

186
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,020
Let's just do that first measure,

187
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,740
ready, your hand is going down up, down up,

188
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,350
ready go now,

189
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,400
down, down up, up, down,

190
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,970
down, let's repeat that first measure,

191
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,590
down, down up, up, down,

192
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,600
so there's a silent down in there,

193
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,950
down up, up, down,

194
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,720
let's slow a way down for you,

195
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,360
down, down up, up, down,

196
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,810
down, down up, up, down,

197
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,730
may take you a while to get it at first.

198
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,020
Okay, start again,

199
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,830
ready go, down,

200
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,360
down, down up, up, down,

201
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,480
down, down up, up, down.

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,670
Okay, now let's do that musical example number one,

203
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,190
two measures of G, two measures of C,

204
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,310
ready, play,

205
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,160
up, up, down,

206
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,160
again, down, down up,

207
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,510
now, C chord,

208
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,310
back to G,

209
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,990
C.

210
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,760
Now number two,

211
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,680
starts with a C7 chord,

212
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,490
okay, remember our good open C7 chord

213
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,770
and I changed the rhythm up a little bit on this one,

214
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,300
okay, so let's take a look at it,

215
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,990
down up, down up, up, down,

216
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,510
down up, down up, up, down,

217
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,740
now let's try with the chord,

218
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,180
we'll do it nice and slow first,

219
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,400
ready, go,

220
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,070
up, down,

221
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,470
again, down up, down up, up, down,

222
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,550
down up, down up, up, down.

223
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,530
Okay, now let's play that whole pattern,

224
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,650
ready, number two, ready, go,

225
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,650
Am7,

226
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,980
Dm7,

227
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,290
G7,

228
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,310
one more time,

229
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,520
keep your wrist loose,

230
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,910
very good, you're going to make sure that wrist is loose in there,

231
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,670
if you get too stressed out about it,

232
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,500
you'll end up sounding real choppy.

233
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,280
Let's do number three,

234
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,380
okay, this is the third most common,

235
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,220
not most common, but a third common strumming pattern,

236
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,560
you ready, starts on Ab,

237
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,430
down up, up, up, down,

238
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,600
down up, up, up, down,

239
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,980
here we go, on a Ab,

240
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,310
ready, go,

241
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,410
down up, up, up, down,

242
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:31,980
again,

243
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,500
got it,

244
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,990
okay, now let's play the whole line,

245
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,550
ready, go.

246
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:59,250
do it again.

247
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,360
Good.

248
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,020
Now the main thing you want to keep a in mind

249
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,970
as you're doing this strumming is

250
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,850
you want to make sure you're keep your hand going,

251
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,900
make sure your wrist is loose,

252
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,880
as you speed up things,

253
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,520
don't tense up, relax that wrist even more,

254
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,450
that's what you want to do.

255
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,100
Now, those are a couple of patterns,

256
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,660
there's another one on your page as well,

257
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,530
but that's just some simple ideas to get you started on strumming,

258
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,310
ideally, I don't want you to be thinking down, down up, up, down,

259
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,840
as you're trying to play a song,

260
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,840
once you get used to the flow of it,

261
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,490
so once you get these,

262
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,040
try and not look at the music,

263
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,980
and do the same strumming,

264
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,390
like for number one would be down, down up, up, down,

265
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,860
so at first when you're thinking about it,

266
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,530
let's say we're doing on the G chord,

267
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,240
down, down up, up, down,

268
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,950
I don't want you, I want you to

269
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,610
as you speed up, not to have to think about the downs and ups,

270
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,750
and that's about strumming

271
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,360
and the rest is up to you to perfect it

272
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,000
and to get a strong and smooth,

273
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,500
takes a little bit of time,

274
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,550
don't be discouraged,

275
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,650
it takes a little bit of time and effort,

276
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,110
main thing, relax, keep that hand going.

277
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,910
Now let's learn a little bit about intervals in our next section.

278
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,780
Okay, welcome to intervals,

279
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,820
we've talked about half steps and whole steps,

280
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,440
we've talked about major scales,

281
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,840
we've talked about keys and key signatures,

282
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,640
now we're up to intervals,

283
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,930
well, what are intervals,

284
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,100
intervals, what I'm talking about is the distance between two notes,

285
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,030
not notes that are right next to each other,

286
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,230
like a half step and whole step,

287
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,460
notes that are beyond that,

288
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,840
like if I'm in the key of C

289
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,680
and I want to know the distance between a C and an E,

290
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,050
that would be an interval,

291
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,750
a C to an F, a C to a B,

292
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,460
all of those would be intervals,

293
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,230
now there's two different types,

294
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,340
there's intervals that are within the major scale or built off the major scale,

295
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,030
these are called diatonic intervals,

296
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,890
diatonic, means inside the scale,

297
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
now, the two different,

298
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,120
we're going to separate those intervals up a little bit,

299
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:45,270
the second, the third, the sixth and the seventh are all referred to as major intervals,

300
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,490
don't get that confused with major chords,

301
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,710
we're talking about intervals, completely different thing,

302
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,550
the second, third, sixth and seventh are major intervals,

303
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,890
we just kind of split those intervals up into two groups

304
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,060
and call them different things,

305
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:05,460
the intervals that are left are the fourth, the fifth and the octave, or the eighth,

306
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,200
okay, those intervals aren't called major intervals,

307
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,480
those intervals are called perfect,

308
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,310
I don't know why it's that way,

309
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,630
it's just kind of how it is,

310
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,810
major intervals, second, third, sixth and seventh,

311
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,110
perfect intervals, fourth, fifth and octave.

312
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,640
Okay, now, so let me ask you a couple of questions, a different way,

313
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,960
if I said in C, what is the perfect fourth,

314
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,300
the answer would be F,

315
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,730
the only thing you're listening for is,

316
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,440
when I say fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, second,

317
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,360
okay, there's little names that are going to go in front of those,

318
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,650
that are not important at this point,

319
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,390
they're going to be important later on,

320
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,830
but at this point, just realized there's a group of major, there's a group of perfect,

321
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,610
so if I said to you an F, what is the major sixth,

322
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,530
well, the major sixth in F would be a D,

323
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,260
if I'm in Bb and I say what's the major seventh,

324
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,980
that would be the seventh step and then Bb that would be an A.

325
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,510
Now let's talk about the other group, harmonic intervals,

326
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,940
these are intervals that are not within the scale,

327
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,500
they're going to take the ones from the scale,

328
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,790
but we're going to adjust them a little bit.

329
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,010
Okay, so we're gonna adjust up

330
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,380
either a half step up or a half step down.

331
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,890
Okay, if I call,

332
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,260
and again we gotta just into two groups again,

333
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,920
the major intervals, if I raise them up a half step,

334
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,890
that's called an augmented interval,

335
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,720
what is an augmented second, augmented sixth,

336
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,100
okay, augmented is also used to describe going a half step up for the perfect intervals,

337
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,530
so really, if you're going to half step up on any interval outside of the major scale,

338
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,210
it's going to be referred to as augmented,

339
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,520
even augmented fourth augmented fifth.

340
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,970
So if I wanted to,

341
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,210
in C, if I wanted an augmented fifth, let's say,

342
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,080
that would be a G#,

343
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,280
G would be the fifth,

344
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,280
augmented that, G would be the G#.

345
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,690
Okay, now if I want to go down on the major intervals,

346
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,790
that's referred to as minor,

347
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,700
okay, don't get that confused with minor chords or anything like that,

348
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,720
in intervals, major if I want to lower that interval a half step,

349
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,650
that's called minor,

350
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,220
if I'm in F and I want the minor third,

351
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,440
in F, I go to the third step, which is an A,

352
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,030
but now I'm making it minor

353
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,560
or I'm going down a half step,

354
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,450
then it would be an Ab,

355
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,810
so the minor third in F would be an Ab.

356
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,120
If I want to go down on a perfect interval,

357
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,760
fourth, fifth or octave,

358
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,560
I refer to that as diminished,

359
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,430
if I'm in G

360
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,740
and I say, well, what's the diminished fifth,

361
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,250
in G, I would go up to the fifth step, which is a D

362
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,870
and go down a half step, Db,

363
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,170
a diminished fifth would be a Db,

364
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,430
don't get confused,

365
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,750
I could ask it this way,

366
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,450
in G, what is the augmented fourth,

367
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,130
well, the augmented fourth would be,

368
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,270
I go up to C,

369
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,320
and then go up one, that would be a C#,

370
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,190
but now you're saying to yourself,

371
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,020
well, Steve, that means that the augmented fourth and diminished fifth are the same note,

372
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,020
yes, they are the same note,

373
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,670
but it's called by two different things,

374
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,890
if I asked you for the augmented fourth,

375
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,650
you have to tell me C#,

376
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,420
if you answer Db,

377
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,600
that's wrong,

378
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,740
that would be diminished fifth,

379
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,520
see how that works.

380
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,150
Okay, now let's talk about in enharmonic tones,

381
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,730
big word, all it means is that,

382
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,960
some tones like a C# and Db are going to be one pitch,

383
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,280
but have two different names,

384
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,870
that's what enharmonic tones are.

385
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,000
The other thing, as we're adjusting these intervals,

386
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,110
sometimes you're going to need to flat an already flatted note,

387
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,400
what if I'm in a,

388
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,940
let's say, I'm in Eb and I want a diminished fifth,

389
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,590
well, the fifth in Eb is a Bb,

390
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,090
but I want to make that lower,

391
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,990
how do I do that,

392
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,330
I do what's called a double flat.

393
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,660
Here's your assignment for the week,

394
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,920
now that we've got all that theory stuff out of, out of the way,

395
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,210
here's your assignment for this week,

396
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,850
I want you practice the songs that we have in the book,

397
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,090
dealing with the strumming patterns,

398
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,640
using the strumming patterns that we've learned,

399
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,200
some of the simple ones that we've talked about,

400
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,810
I want you to complete the intervals worksheets,

401
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,480
talks about when in C, what's the third,

402
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,520
and F, what's the six that sort of thing.

403
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,570
Okay, let's go ahead and go to the workshop time

404
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,290
and I'll see you there.

405
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,540
Alright, let's work out some of these things now,

406
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,640
in our workshop time,

407
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,890
we want to talk about basic,

408
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,020
the basic strumming patterns that we talked about.

409
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,280
Let's go through those,

410
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,390
the first one was,

411
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,430
down, down up, up, down.

412
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,070
Let's do that together on a G chord,

413
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,140
ready, go,

414
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,280
down, down up, up, down,

415
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,760
down, down up, up, down,

416
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,860
down, a bit faster,

417
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,720
a little faster, you're doing great.

418
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,670
Good, let's play exercise number one,

419
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,630
start out nice and slow, then will speed up,

420
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,880
ready, go,

421
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,520
now a C chord,

422
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,230
back to G,

423
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,620
try not to hesitate between chords,

424
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,810
slow and even strums.

425
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,650
Good, now let's play a little bit faster,

426
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,960
ready, go.

427
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,780
Very good, okay, now let's go to number two,

428
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,540
starts on that C7,

429
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,250
we'll do it slow first time,

430
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,590
ready, play,

431
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,030
down up, down up, up, down,

432
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,710
down up, down up, up, down,

433
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,080
down up, down up,

434
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,710
do it again,

435
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:28,460
C7, down up, down up, up, down,

436
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,860
keep that hand going.

437
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,510
Very, very good,

438
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,820
okay, number two, a little bit faster,

439
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,510
ready, go.

440
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,180
Now, ready for number three,

441
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,830
slow at first, down up, up and go,

442
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,550
again.

443
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:54,250
Good, now a little bit faster,

444
00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:15,040
one two, ready, go.

445
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:22,420
Number four, ready, go,

446
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,340
Now, a little bit faster,

447
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:15,310
ready, one two, ready and go.

448
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,420
Great, now let's move on to our first song,

449
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,180
are actually the only song that we're gonna cover in this workshop portion.

450
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,190
La Bamba,

451
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,800
okay, you've got the single notes to it

452
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,300
and you've also got the chords,

453
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,370
let's just touch on those single notes first,

454
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,760
because we've got some rhythm things that we need to deal with as well,

455
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,510
so we'll go through it,

456
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,420
one time slowly, then one time a little bit faster,

457
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,770
single notes first.

458
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,020
One two three four, one,

459
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,560
three four, rest,

460
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:04,280
rest,

461
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:13,270
rest rest, one two three four, one two,

462
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,200
three four,

463
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,670
three four.

464
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,340
Okay, now let's go through the single notes a little bit faster,

465
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,800
one two three four, one,

466
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,450
three four, rest,

467
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,160
three four, rest, two three four,

468
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,680
three four,

469
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,230
three four.

470
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,330
Great, okay, now let's do the chords on it,

471
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,030
two different strumming patterns we're going to use in this one,

472
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,580
when you, when you have a measure that has two chords in it,

473
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,080
I just want you to go,

474
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,500
down, down up, on the first chord

475
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,820
and then the same thing, down, down up, on the second chord,

476
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,250
if you have a measure that's split into two chords per measure.

477
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,710
Okay, so the measures that do that,

478
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,500
in this song have an A and a D in them,

479
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,070
so if we were playing just that measure with A and D,

480
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,080
it would sound something like this,

481
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,030
ready, go.

482
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,640
Good, let's do that a couple times through,

483
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,630
we'll just repeat it,

484
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:07,290
just that A and D, go,,

485
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,370
now, the measure with an E in it,

486
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,710
is we're gonna go ahead and use that strumming pattern,

487
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,400
down, down up, up, down,

488
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,820
down, down up, up, down,

489
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,630
so on an E chord,

490
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,460
it would be down, down up, up, down,

491
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,820
down, down up, up, down.

492
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,960
Okay, now the song starts off with those pickup notes,

493
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,310
coming into that measure,

494
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,510
starting with the A,

495
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,790
so I'm going to start on that measure with the A,

496
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,630
then we'll go from there.

497
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,880
One, go slow first, ready go,

498
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,190
now the full pattern,

499
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,220
last measure.

500
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,660
Okay, now let's play it a little bit quicker,

501
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,220
more up to the tempo of the song.

502
00:31:36,740 --> 00:32:06,500
One two three four's,

503
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,370
here we go.

504
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,940
Very good, okay, now let's do it even faster,

505
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,530
one more time, even faster,

506
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,730
just to see if we can keep up.

507
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,010
One two, ready, go,

508
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,320
and that's La Bamba.

509
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,170
Now, there's many more songs in the Jam Along CDs,

510
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,540
you get a whole lot more practice on these songs,

511
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,730
than just one tune that we're able to do here,

512
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,530
and all the practice you can get is going to be well worth your while

513
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:01,030
in making your strums solid, strong, but still smooth

514
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,010
and where you get them fast enough to do, what you need to do.

515
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,300
We'll see you next time.
