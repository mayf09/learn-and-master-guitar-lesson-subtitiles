00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:20,810
Hi, welcome to session twelve of learn and master guitar,

2
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,480
we're still working on learning and mastering this wonderful instrument,

3
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,920
this time, we're gonna talk about getting into some more advanced chords,

4
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,930
two chords,

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,880
we're going to talk about minor eleventh chords,

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,410
talk about major seventh chords,

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,860
chords that take you beyond what every other guitar player in the world is doing,

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,290
because everybody knows the first batch of chords,

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,820
but now we're going to take you beyond that,

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,830
to make your playing something special,

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,250
in the guitar tips section,

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,590
we're going to talk about chord substitution,

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,390
how you can look at a page

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,550
and even though it has C F and G

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,050
just like every other piece of music,

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,840
how you can grab some more different colors out of those chords

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,010
to set your playing a part,

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,790
going beyond what is written on the page

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,010
to give you that great sound that you're looking for,

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,360
so let's go ahead and get started.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,860
Okay, now we're going to talk about

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,580
going beyond the regular batch of chords that everybody knows

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,610
and getting into a little bit more of some advanced chords,

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,110
some chords that add some color and some depth and some richness to your playing,

25
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,060
I learned some of these two chords

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,740
and I tell you I use them every time I play in a live situation or in a studio situation,

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,230
they just add that extra little bit of color,

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,730
that separates you from the guitar player sitting next to you,

29
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,100
that only knows C G and D.

30
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,280
So here we go, let's talk about the first batch of chords,

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,870
we're talking about two chords,

32
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,460
what two chords are,

33
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,030
a regular chord has,

34
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,830
a regular major chord,

35
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,970
let's say a C major is using three different tones, a C E and G,

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,630
and we'll explain why that is in a future session,

37
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,230
but for right now it's using three different notes C E and G,

38
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,490
a two chord adds the second step of that major scale,

39
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,950
that D into that mix,

40
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,260
so now there's four tones messing around in there, C D E and G,

41
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,750
for a two chord,

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,640
so it just adds the second step of the scale into the triad of the chord

43
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,960
and that's what a two chord is,

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,290
so we're going to very quickly go through some basic open, using open string two chords,

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,110
I'm going to cover a couple of movable versions for you,

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,420
so you're going to cover these pretty quickly

47
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,840
and then we're going to do some exercises with them.

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,900
Okay, first, we're going to cover is a C2,

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,640
that's one way to play it,

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,510
with your third finger, second and your pinky down here,

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,830
another way to do it,

52
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,260
which is a little more comfortable for me,

53
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,750
is to go two one and your third finger down here,

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,840
you can kind of hear, here's a C chord,

55
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,030
adding that second step that D in there,

56
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,620
gives it just a little bit more color,

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,000
that's a C2.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,890
Next when we come to is a D2,

59
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,600
well, here's our D,

60
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,280
if I want a D2,

61
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,320
I just take that second finger off,

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,980
it's kind of an open sweet sound,

63
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,290
that's a D2,

64
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:36,700
a lot of times you'll hear a D going back and forth D2,

65
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,570
real common thing,

66
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,280
that's where that D2 comes in.

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,380
Next one we're going to cover is E2,

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,270
this one, here's a normal E,

69
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,300
for an E2, we add the pinky out here,

70
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,070
we gotta stretch out to that F#,

71
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,900
which is a little bit of a stretch,

72
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,300
it might be difficult for your hand to do it the first time,

73
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,350
but don't give up,

74
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,110
remember limberness your hand takes time,

75
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,350
you may think, there's no way my pinky could stretch out there,

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,260
actually your hand can stretch pretty wide,

77
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,910
if you need it to do so,

78
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,720
and it just requires getting your hand a little bit more limber,

79
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,110
remember our finger exercise or stretching exercises,

80
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,840
all these things will help that hand limber up,

81
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,030
I used to could never get an E2,

82
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,250
but once you do it a few times,

83
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,020
it gets more and more limber can do that,

84
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,410
here's an E, here's an E2,

85
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,270
F# in there, that's what gives it that rich sound.

86
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,950
Next one is a G2,

87
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,110
here would be a G, and G2,

88
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,760
I just dropped my second finger down to cover this A,

89
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,570
now you'll notice,

90
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,390
that I had to take it off of this fifth string,

91
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,520
well, what happens is that fifth string now,

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,800
my third finger is muting that string,

93
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,240
if if I went through it, just individual notes,

94
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,860
you'd hear that dead string on that fifth string,

95
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,430
I just, his little rear end is sitting on top of that string,

96
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,040
so in the heat of battle,

97
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,210
when you play the whole chord,

98
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,370
you don't hear that dead string,

99
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,320
but it's in there,

100
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,580
it's just covered up by the others,

101
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,630
that's a G2.

102
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,610
Next one is an A2,

103
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,140
here's A,

104
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,250
A2, I just take that pinky off,

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,470
it's a real open sound.

106
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,550
Going through those again,

107
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:40,650
C2, D2, E2, G2 and A2.

108
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,240
Now those may be coming pretty fast by you right now,

109
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,860
as you practice them a little bit,

110
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,380
you those will get more and more underneath your fingers,

111
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,250
now let's talk about,

112
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,160
those are the open forms, that you use most often.

113
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,650
Now here we're going to talk about the movable forms,

114
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,630
once you get a couple of movable forms in you,

115
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,540
remember you can play that anywhere on the neck in any key,

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,410
so I'm going to give you an F2, and a B2,

117
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,140
I may even sneak in a G2 in there too,

118
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,730
a six string form of it,

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,130
so you can play anywhere on the neck.

120
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,200
Okay, so we're gonna start on F2 first,

121
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,940
this one is based on the third fret,

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,020
you're borrowing this first finger all the way down,

123
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,290
you have a C here, an F here and a G underneath,

124
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,640
that's a four string chord,

125
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,440
where's the F in this F2,

126
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,810
right here on our first finger right there,

127
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,520
that's the note you're pivoting off of,

128
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,080
so if I want to,

129
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,690
let's say, make that F#2,

130
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,830
I move this up to an F#

131
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,900
and I go from there,

132
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,850
if I want an Ab,

133
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,890
it would be like that.

134
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,380
So I have F2,

135
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,600
now if you want to think of it this way,

136
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,720
if I keep going down, E2, Eb2,

137
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,980
if I went down one more,

138
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,510
then I run off my neck,

139
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,730
but look there's my D2,

140
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,080
so it's really the same form,

141
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,030
I just barre it, to make where,

142
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,710
I could make it in different places on the neck,

143
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,100
that's F2, that's a four string version of it.

144
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,540
If I wanted to use something on the fifth string,

145
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,270
let's do a Bb2 or a B2,

146
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,880
let's do a B2, keep it consistent,

147
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,970
it's kind of like our Bm, Bm that we had,

148
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,560
I take my second finger off,

149
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,490
make sure that barres down nice and strong,

150
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,510
and I get a B2

151
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,640
and again where's the B,

152
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,780
where's the pivot note,

153
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,690
right where that diamond is at on that fifth string,

154
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,240
so if I want to D2,

155
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,230
in that barre form,

156
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,180
let's make it an Eb2 that way,

157
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,980
doesn't get confused with the other,

158
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,130
I come up here to Eb, there's my Eb

159
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,510
and there's my two chord.

160
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,920
Okay, so I've got a four string version,

161
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,270
I've got a fifth string version.

162
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,410
Now the only low version I know is

163
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,750
kind of a growl kind of sound,

164
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,770
that I use sometimes,

165
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,400
Let's see, if I want a G2, in a barre version,

166
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,900
I just do this one,

167
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,680
a little bit of a stretch,

168
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,360
especially to get that second and third finger separated away from each other,

169
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,510
and I just do the first of, the bottom four strings,

170
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,920
remember movable chords,

171
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
don't use any open strings,

172
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,170
that's a secret,

173
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,480
where's the G in this G2,

174
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,530
right there,

175
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,370
if I want a B2, be right there,

176
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,230
or A2,

177
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,660
I use this chord sometimes,

178
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:40,590
if I want to get to a real open sound,

179
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,920
it's a very distinctive kind of an open sound

180
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,360
using all those fifths and fourths.

181
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,040
Those are some two chords,

182
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,380
now we covered what six or seven forms there,

183
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,900
those are the main batch that I use,

184
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,990
okay, I got moveable ones,

185
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,130
I can play in any key,

186
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,470
I've got three different types I choose removable ones,

187
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,850
I've got my open ones down here,

188
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,330
if I want to get that sweet open string ringing sound,

189
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,140
let's talk about the next batch major seventh chords.

190
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,610
Okay, major seventh chords,

191
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,920
we're gonna run through about six or seven of these.

192
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,320
A Cmaj7, open version,

193
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,210
here's my C,

194
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,960
take my first finger off,

195
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,570
I have a good Cmaj7,

196
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,990
very common progression,

197
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,450
using that open Cmaj7.

198
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,490
Next one is a Dmaj7,

199
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,090
this one is a little bit different,

200
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,230
there's our D,

201
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,210
but I have to switch my fingers around on this,

202
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,990
when I use my second finger and my third finger to get this,

203
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,020
Dmaj7, actually that was the Dmaj9,

204
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,740
let me show you this one,

205
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,020
Dmaj7 would be this way,

206
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,880
barring that first finger on that second fret, all the way down,

207
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,910
Dmaj7, D, Dmaj7.

208
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,410
Okay, next, let's go to an Fmaj7,

209
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,900
here would be an F,

210
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,520
bottom half of it would be like this,

211
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,560
if I want an Fmaj7,

212
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,670
I just come up on this,

213
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,370
so I have an F and A a C

214
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,670
and then this open E string right there,

215
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,900
Fmaj7.

216
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,610
Let's do a Gmaj7,

217
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,840
or you could do it that way too,

218
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,280
let's teach you that way,

219
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,620
again I have my dead string right here,

220
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,570
and first finger down here on this F#.

221
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,700
Now these don't sound too interesting,

222
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,770
when you just kind of plan in a row like that,

223
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,990
when you combine them with other chord changes,

224
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,460
that's where the color starts to come in.

225
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,530
Next one is a Amaj7,

226
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,240
here's A,

227
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,460
if I switch my fingers around a little bit,

228
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,960
I get an Amaj7,

229
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:02,640
second finger, first finger, third finger and then open,

230
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,600
Amaj7.

231
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,320
Those are the basic major seventh open chords,

232
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:20,700
Cmaj7, Dmaj7, Fmaj7, Gmaj7, and Amaj7.

233
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,270
Okay, now the move, as far as the movable forms,

234
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,110
well what can we do,

235
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,210
well, here's the two that I use the most,

236
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,790
if I'm basing it off of the fifth string,

237
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,750
it would be a Bb

238
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,850
or let's do it, let's do it Bb,

239
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,910
it's kind of a Bb7 would be,

240
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,210
but I put my second finger down here on the second fret on the third string,

241
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,060
and I get a Bbmaj7,

242
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,640
where's the Bb in this Bbmaj7,

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,140
right here on that first fret, second, fifth string,

244
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,010
this is where the Bb is.

245
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,140
So if I wanted an Ebmaj7,

246
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,470
I'd have to come up, do something like that.

247
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,400
Okay, next one on the sixth string is going to Fmaj7

248
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,430
and that's this one,

249
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,230
again, I'm muting out that fifth string,

250
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,480
no barre in this one

251
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,070
and I just play the five strings,

252
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,210
I don't play this last string,

253
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,740
because that would be an open string

254
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,580
and then it wouldn't work,

255
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,040
so if I want an Abmaj7,

256
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,660
I just move this up to Ab,

257
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,640
there's Ab,

258
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,530
what about a Dbmaj7,

259
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,540
no problem, I don't need my Mel Bay's chord bible for this,

260
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,430
I just know three forms

261
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,110
and I know where to put them in different places,

262
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,250
I don't need to go through 50 million different permutations of it,

263
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,280
in order to come up with an Fmaj7 or a Dbmaj7,

264
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm a guitar player,

265
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,620
I went the easy way,

266
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,120
so I only know three of them,

267
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,140
and you just put it in the place that you need to use that.

268
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,920
Okay, here's one on the fourth string,

269
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,080
let's say I wanted to do an Ebmaj7,

270
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,130
I do this, I barre these three,

271
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,230
remember how our Dmaj7 was like this,

272
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,250
I screwed it up and make a barre out of it,

273
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,660
Ebmaj7

274
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,840
and then I've got one on the fourth string,

275
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,430
I've got a version on the fifth string,

276
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,350
I got a version on the six string,

277
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,980
I can play Ebmaj7 -} all over the neck all day long,

278
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,710
that's where the beauty of these movable chords comes into.

279
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,330
Okay, the last batch, okay, is minor eleventh chords,

280
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,370
we've covered what about fifteen chords so far,

281
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,170
I've got a couple more I'm gonna lay on you here,

282
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,490
there's only two, that I really use for open minor eleventh chords,

283
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,940
don't worry about the eleventh chord,

284
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,140
all that is is I'm adding the fourth step of the scale,

285
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,720
which is the eleventh,

286
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,070
it just repeats,

287
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,630
if I keep going up the major scale,

288
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,070
one two three four five six seven eight,

289
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,200
I hit the octave 9 11,

290
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,550
it goes up to actually the fourth degree of the scale,

291
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,740
which is the same as the eleventh degree,

292
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,850
which is the same as the fourth,

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,990
don't get too lost in that,

294
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,040
we'll learn more about that later.

295
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,340
But we're going to start off with an open F#m11,

296
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,200
again, I'm muting this fifth string,

297
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,110
so I don't want to put it so up to that fifth string comes through,

298
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,180
I don't want that,

299
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,290
I want to mute it out

300
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,510
and I have these two open,

301
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,610
pinky on the A, third finger on the E,

302
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,100
second finger I like to use up here on the F#,

303
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,820
okay, that works great for open minor eleventh chord,

304
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,370
if I want one off the fifth string,

305
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,850
it would be like a Bm11,

306
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,530
okay, here I could mute,

307
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,350
if I want to or not mute that in a string,

308
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,090
that's a Bm11,

309
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,170
F#m11, Bm11.

310
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,700
Now if I'm going a little fast for you,

311
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,750
just put it on pause,

312
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,880
get these chord forms underneath your belt

313
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,200
and then come back to me.

314
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,240
Okay.

315
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,150
Let's talk about some movable ones,

316
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,720
if I want to move this,

317
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,250
here's that F#m11,

318
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,540
well if I just move it up a half step

319
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,100
and put my first finger down here,

320
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:20,140
don't use that last six string or last first string here,

321
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,610
I just hit these five,

322
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,500
I get a Gm11

323
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,570
and again that one doesn't have any open strings,

324
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,060
so yeah, I can move that anywhere I want,

325
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,550
Bbm11, no problem,

326
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,130
move it up to Bb, make my chord here.

327
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,790
Okay, if I wanted one that's based off of the fifth string,

328
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,880
well, here's my Bm11 remember,

329
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,980
well if I screwed him up a half step

330
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,230
and kind of barre this over here,

331
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,030
again that may be a little bit of a stretch,

332
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,040
that's a Cm11,

333
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,130
here's the C in that Cm11.

334
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,320
But Steve, I need an Fm11,

335
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,990
hey, no problem,

336
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,630
I screwed up to F

337
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,490
and I make the minor eleventh there.

338
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,180
See how that works,

339
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,350
I don't need to look at my chord bible to find it,

340
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,090
I only know a couple of forms,

341
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,950
I know where to move them in different spots,

342
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,570
that's what that comes down to.

343
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,770
After this, we're gonna go into some exercises

344
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,720
and work on these chord forms that we just learned.

345
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,390
Okay, now we're going to talk about some guitar tips

346
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,490
on how to use these chords that we've learned,

347
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,070
you've got a whole new batch of chords underneath your belt,

348
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,320
now it's not all that many,

349
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,560
I mean, we've learned the basic chords, which that was what about twenty chords,

350
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,170
I've just taught you about another twenty chords,

351
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,740
so now it's really only about forty chords, we know,

352
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,560
which sounds huge,

353
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,940
but once you play him a lot,

354
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,980
he gets to be just like the alphabet,

355
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,230
I mean just you can go through in any key

356
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
and these chords separate the men from the boys

357
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,320
on playing harmonies and making creative chord progressions,

358
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,520
you ever listen to a song

359
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,890
and you think gosh it just sounds so rich what he's playing,

360
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,090
a lot of what he's doing,

361
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,230
it's just some simple tricks

362
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,430
of which here's one of the main ones, chord substitution.

363
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,200
Okay, when I look at a piece of paper,

364
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,290
they put out, they put a piece of music for me on a studio session

365
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,360
and they say, okay, well, here's the chords,

366
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,190
it goes from a C to a G,

367
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,450
okay, I don't play a C and a G,

368
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,030
because every other [] going to play a C and a G,

369
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,720
just like this,

370
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,840
I substitute a two chord for both of those,

371
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,890
here's the rule,

372
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,630
you can substitute a two chord for any major chord,

373
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,070
you can substitute a two chord for any major chord,

374
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,260
so if it's a C, it's an F,

375
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,110
if it's a Bb, Gb, Ab,

376
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,010
doesn't matter,

377
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,680
you can substitute a two chord for that

378
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,990
and it's going to sound rich and full,

379
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,910
it works a hundred percent of the time.

380
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,020
Okay, so if it's if it's going from a C to a G,

381
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,190
let's say the chord progression is that,

382
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,260
okay, well, I don't, I don't play that,

383
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,620
I play a C2 to maybe a G2,

384
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,830
it just gives it a little bit more color,

385
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,080
a little bit more depth to what we're playing,

386
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,690
that's the first rule, two chords,

387
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,610
what's the rule,

388
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,850
you can add a two chord to any major chord,

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,170
the chord says D,

390
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,040
I don't play a D,

391
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,150
I hardly ever play a D,

392
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,560
I play a D2,

393
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,580
it says G,

394
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,380
I don't play G, I play G2,

395
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,200
well, isn't that going to screw up the rest of the band, nope,

396
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,430
I can pretty much say,

397
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,540
for these two chords,

398
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,350
you can it's never going to screw up the rest of the band,

399
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,530
because you're just adding a little bit of color into the mix,

400
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,630
so you're not changing the harmony or anything like that,

401
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,680
you're adding a little bit of color.

402
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,030
Talk about the second one,

403
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,400
the second one is a minor eleventh,

404
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,080
well, what can I do,

405
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,640
if it's a minor chord,

406
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,330
I can substitute a minor eleventh for it,

407
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,800
and almost all the time,

408
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,180
you'll never have a problem with it,

409
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,820
that one I have to have a little bit more of a clarification on it,

410
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,650
with the minor eleventh,

411
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,540
they work almost all the time,

412
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,670
so any when I see a minor chord,

413
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,040
I can substitute in a minor eleventh

414
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,660
and it's not going to throw anybody off.

415
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,120
Okay, so those are the two rules,

416
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,470
two chords for major,

417
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,530
eleventh minor eleventh chords for minor.

418
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,450
Here's your assignment for this week,

419
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,550
I want you to practice all of the advanced chord forms, that we've just learned,

420
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,990
get them underneath your fingers,

421
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,760
be able to play in different parts of the neck,

422
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,660
be able to play them enough to where you're not hesitating when you get to them

423
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,730
and you can form them in one block, not note note note,

424
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,050
you know sometimes when you're going for a chord

425
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,880
and as you're just learning it,

426
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,870
you kind of start off with,

427
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,520
well here's my first finger there,

428
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,000
next one you kind of build it in, blah, in in a sequence

429
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,170
of putting your fingers down,

430
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,140
you want to get these chords down enough to where you come as a block.

431
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:17,030
Okay, practice all your advanced chord forms,

432
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,060
play through the chord substitution exercises in your book,

433
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,470
there's also gonna be exercises

434
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,510
getting your fingers familiar with these various advanced chord forms too,

435
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,520
also remember the Jam Along CDs,

436
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,370
you can always get more resources off of that,

437
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,650
as well as there's extra resources in your book as well,

438
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,900
so let's go ahead and work out at the workshop

439
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,560
and I'll see you there.

440
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,400
Okay, now let's put,

441
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,540
in our workshop time,

442
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,550
all these chord substitutions that we've learned

443
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,310
and the new chords into a working environment,

444
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,900
where you can start getting the most out of it.

445
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,920
Okay, so look at your a chord exercises page,

446
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,390
okay, we're going to do number one,

447
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,860
we'll start off pretty slow

448
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,970
and then we'll speed it up,

449
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,920
give you a chance to get these chords underneath your belt.

450
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,300
Okay, number one, starts out with two chord exercises,

451
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,260
ready, starts on a C2, go,

452
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,000
Am7,

453
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,310
D2,

454
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,600
G2,

455
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,380
just running you through these chords,

456
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,050
then C.

457
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,960
Do it again, a little bit faster,

458
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,780
let me try that,

459
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,740
let me see if I can get right,

460
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,910
ready, go.

461
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,020
Okay, look at the second one,

462
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,970
that starts out on an E2,

463
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,770
ready, get that form right,

464
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,780
get that pinky stretching all the way out there,

465
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,910
ready, go,

466
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,790
A2,

467
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,870
back to E2,

468
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,150
A2.

469
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,620
Now, I'm not very, I'm not giving you very complex on your rhythm,

470
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,860
because I really wanted you to focus on forming these chords.

471
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,390
Okay, number three, get a little work on these open chords

472
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,830
and some of the movable ones,

473
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,300
F2, starts it out,

474
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,490
ready, go,

475
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,750
Gm7,

476
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,720
Bb2 is next,

477
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,410
Csus,,

478
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,730
C7.

479
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,250
Let's do it again,

480
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,160
F2

481
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,710
Gm7

482
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,880
try get all those notes to ring out, no buzzes,

483
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,530
Csus,

484
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,700
C7,

485
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,340
F2.

486
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,420
Great, okay, now let's take a look at some of the major seventh forms that we've learned,

487
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:48,280
remember, Cmaj7, Fmaj7, Dmaj7, Amaj7, okay, Gmaj7,

488
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:54,640
the movable ones, Fmaj7, Bbmaj7 and Ebmaj7.

489
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,950
okay, so what is that about eight forms.

490
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,090
Get little practice on that,

491
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,680
starting with number one, major seventh chord exercises number one,

492
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,800
you ready, starts on that Cmaj7

493
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,150
and I gave a little rhythm there,

494
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,390
down, down up, up, down,

495
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,290
here we go, one two, nice and slow, go,

496
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,420
Dm7,

497
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,060
Fmaj7,

498
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,280
Gsus, I gotta do a barre form,

499
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,410
Cmaj7,

500
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,450
Okay, now let's try and do the next one,

501
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,340
starts on a Dmaj7,

502
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,410
okay, now look at that rhythm,

503
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,490
down, up, keep that hand going, down, up,

504
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,570
okay, two, ready, play,

505
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,940
Em7,

506
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,090
Asus,

507
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,490
Gmaj7,

508
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,430
Asus,

509
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,710
Dmaj7

510
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,670
Do it again, little bit faster,

511
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,320
Em7,

512
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,980
Asus,

513
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
Gmaj7,

514
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,250
Asus,

515
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,710
Dmaj7.

516
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,230
Great, gives you a little practice with those,

517
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,540
now let's go on to minor elevens,

518
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,540
okay, starts out with an E2

519
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,420
and it goes on to there that F#m11,

520
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,680
look at that rhythm too,

521
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,120
let's start it nice and slow,

522
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,210
one, two, ready go,

523
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,780
down, down up, keep your hand going,

524
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:56,530
down, down up, keep the hand going,

525
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,020
Bm11,

526
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:05,540
E7,

527
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,070
Amaj7.

528
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,530
Do it one more time, little faster,

529
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:25,440
A2, Bm11, E7, Amaj7.

530
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,400
Number two, we end up with, start off with a Gm11,

531
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,190
a little bit of a movable chord there,

532
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,660
take a look at that rhythm too,

533
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,980
one two, ready, go,

534
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,020
rest,

535
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
D7,

536
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,030
back to that Gm11,

537
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,960
Dsus,

538
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,820
Gm11.

539
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,850
Great, now let's start looking at some of the chords substitution examples there,

540
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:09,120
the first one there goes through a basic, very basic four chord progression,

541
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:13,250
C Am Dm and G,

542
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,960
now if I just play it normally,

543
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,370
it sounds like this,

544
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,280
okay, now if I substitute to use my chord substitution rules,

545
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,540
what are the two rules,

546
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:38,500
if it's a major chord, I can substitute a two chord in for it,

547
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,400
if it's a minor chord I can substitute a minor eleventh,

548
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,180
so I'm gonna change that C to a C2,

549
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,200
I'm going to change that Am to an Am11,

550
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,630
I'm going to change that Dm to a Dm11,

551
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,780
I'm gonna change that G to a G2,

552
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,610
see how that changes the color.

553
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,660
One two, ready go,

554
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,870
do it again,

555
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,780
did you hear how drastically it changed the color

556
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,310
and made it so much more rich

557
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,590
and totally harmonically interesting to listen to.

558
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,600
Look at that second example there,

559
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,130
starts off with an A,

560
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,840
then goes to an E, F#m and then D,

561
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,090
if I played it normally,

562
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,200
it would sound like this,

563
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,870
sounds pretty plain,

564
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,790
let's throw in our chord substitutions,

565
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,400
I turn the A into an A2,

566
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,070
the E to an E2,

567
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,430
the F#m to an F#m11,

568
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,740
the D to a D2

569
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,900
and see if it does sound a little more colorful to you,

570
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,920
ready, go,

571
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,810
let's play again, do it again,

572
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,600
you hear how much more interesting that becomes to your ear,

573
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,150
and that's what separates some players

574
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,980
and then gives them that distinctive sound

575
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,350
is learning these two chords, learning these major sevenths, learning these minor eleventh

576
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,690
and applying a little bit of chord substitution rules to them,

577
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,150
there's other chord substitution rules as well,

578
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,390
but these two I found have been the most bang for the buck

579
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,880
in learning and getting underneath your fingers.

580
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,930
So I would encourage you to keep on,

581
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,390
trying keep on wrestling with it,

582
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,380
don't give up,

583
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,430
you've come this far,

584
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,320
you can certainly get beyond this

585
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,870
and turn into the guitar player that you were meant to be.

586
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:46,610
we'll see you next time.
