1
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,450
Well, something like that,

2
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,160
hey, welcome to session eleven,

3
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,710
we're going to talk about pentatonic scales,

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,530
guitar player's favorite scale that he needs to know,

5
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,680
in order to do good old fashioned rock and roll soloing,

6
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,170
so many things have started with pentatonic scales,

7
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,520
and that's what we're going to talk about today.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,090
Pentatonic scales are the foundation of soloing,

9
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,700
so we're going to learn about the five pentatonic forms

10
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,010
as well as some common soloing patterns,

11
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,060
for you to get started on,

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,440
in our guitar tips section,

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,670
we're going to talk about learning

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,840
how to play and solo in any key, any place on the neck

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,970
by connecting pentatonic scales,

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,430
the most, one of the most valuable keys, I've ever learned.

17
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,550
So we're going to add a new section

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,290
on developing your musical ears

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,630
to be able to play the ideas, that you hear in your head,

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,130
a little bit about ear training,

21
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,300
training our ears to hear what our mind is telling us to play,

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,740
so we've got to go,

23
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,700
let's get started.

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,160
Okay, today, we're gonna talk about pentatonic scales,

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,980
pentatonic scales are one of the most useful scales,

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,940
that you use for good old-fashioned soloing and rock and roll stuff,

27
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,410
pentatonic, as you can tell by the name,

28
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,020
penta, it's a five note scale,

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,810
and it's based off of the major scale,

30
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,050
it uses takes certain notes out of that major scale

31
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,900
and it forms kind of a mini scale within it,

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,350
a pentatonic scale, a five note scale.

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,580
So what notes does it take,

34
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,690
here we have a C major scale,

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,140
and the notes are C D E F G A B and C,

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:26,080
now we're going to take the first, the second, the third, the fifth and the sixth step out of that scale

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,670
and that's going to form our subset,

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,950
that we're going to call the pentatonic scale,

39
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:38,920
the pentatonic scale is made up of the first, the second, the third, the fifth and the sixth of your major scale,

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,020
you take those notes out, whether it's in C F G whatever

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,840
and you take those notes out and that forms a pentatonic scale,

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,830
so a pentatonic scale in C would be C D E G and A,

43
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,620
C, D E G and A,

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,010
of course you keep going, either, on either side of it,

45
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,750
C D E G and A, just keep repeating.

46
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,730
Now, let's say if we did an F,

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,610
remember our major scales and our keys that were so hard to learn,

48
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,080
here's where it starts paying off,

49
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,280
an F scale, F G A Bb C D E F,

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,380
we're gonna take the one three five six,

51
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,230
one one two three five and six out of that scale,

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,190
you end up with F G A C and D

53
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,640
and that makes up an f major pentatonic scale.

54
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,310
Now here's one thing we need to talk about,

55
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,170
we talked about parallel major and parallel minor in our chords

56
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,470
or in our major scales and our natural minor scale,

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,450
that we talked about a couple of sessions back,

58
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,210
here it's gonna come, it's gonna rear its ugly head again,

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,860
when we start talking about pentatonics,

60
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,770
actually it's not a bad thing, it's a very good thing,

61
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,060
you get two for the price of one,

62
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,610
you can solo in two different keys with only one scale

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,870
and being a guitar player,

64
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,700
I like the easiest way I could do it,

65
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,960
so that's why it starts helping out with that.

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,010
So each of these scales,

67
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,710
that we're going to talk about five different forms,

68
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,380
each of them are going to have a major root,

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,970
I could use them in a major key,

70
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,600
I also with a little bit of calculation, can use them in a minor key,

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,190
so you get two for the price of one,

72
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,880
that's what the relationship between parallel major and parallel minor is,

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
let's refresh our memory on that,

74
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,300
if I'm thinking major,

75
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,660
the sixth step of a major scale is gonna be the natural minor,

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,420
so if I'm in C

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,080
and I want to know the natural minor or the minor root,

78
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,420
it would be a the six step,

79
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,400
if I'm in F, it would be D,

80
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,740
if I'm in Bb, it would be G.

81
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,770
Okay, if I'm going from minus, go the opposite way,

82
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,330
if I'm going from minor,

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,930
well, then you just have to count up two or go to the minor third,

84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,920
if I'm Am, remember it would be a C scale starting on A,

85
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,360
then the relative major would be the third step of that A B C,

86
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,250
so the c would be the relative major,

87
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,720
from, if I'm looking at it from a minor perspective.

88
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,370
Now, let's talk about the first pentatonic form,

89
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,950
okay, there are five forms,

90
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,890
we're going to devote the majority of our time to the first form,

91
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,300
because that's generally what guitar players like to use,

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,700
because we like the easy way and we don't like getting too hard.

93
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,440
So I'm going to touch on the other form,

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,150
so we're going to start with that first pentatonic form.

95
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,990
So take a look at it,

96
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,880
we're going to start at the fifth fret,

97
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,190
in the fifth position, we would call that,

98
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,650
so we move our hand up to the fifth position,

99
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,780
and I'm going to play through these,

100
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,900
you'll notice on your chord block or your diagram there,

101
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,880
we've got a couple of new concepts,

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,870
they're all on there,

103
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,450
it's not meant to be a chord, it's just a pattern of notes,

104
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,070
but you'll also see a diamond,

105
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,720
the diamond is telling you, that's the major root,

106
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,350
if I'm thinking in major, that's the note I'm pivoting off of,

107
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,370
the open circle is gonna be the minor root,

108
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,170
so with each of these scales,

109
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,780
I can think of a major or I can think of a minor.

110
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,890
Okay, so with this one, it starts with the fifth fret

111
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,900
and I'm going to play through it slowly

112
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,040
and then I'll talk to you about it.

113
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,190
Starts on the fifth fret,

114
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:22,720
A and C D E G, A C D E G, A C,

115
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,920
okay, now you play with me,

116
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:37,050
ready, go,

117
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,750
let's go down.

118
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,760
Now, you'll notice the minor root, the open circle is on that six string,

119
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,080
A, first finger,

120
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,740
so this would be an Am pentatonic form,

121
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,270
so if a song is up

122
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,160
and I'm supposed to play Am,

123
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,700
I know I can rip off an Am pentatonic

124
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,380
and I'm going to be in the right key.

125
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,240
Now, but you'll notice the diamond is over this pinky C,

126
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,520
that's if I'm thinking major,

127
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,230
so if I'm in C major,

128
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,900
this song is in C major and I want to play,

129
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,180
I use my pentatonic,

130
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,510
I pivot off of that pinky, C

131
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,580
and that's going to be my major pivot,

132
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,380
so you get two for the price to want on that.

133
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,590
Okay, now let's do it in another place,

134
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,970
let's say I wanted a Gm pentatonic,

135
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,680
well, the minor root, the open circle is with our first finger,

136
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,810
so I put my first finger on G

137
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:59,290
and I do that same form again,

138
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:06,400
going down.

139
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,980
Try a couple more,

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,870
what if I wanted, let's say a D major pentatonic,

141
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,020
well, I'm not pivoting off of my first finger anymore,

142
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,730
I'm pivoting off of that pinky,

143
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,400
so I put my pinky on the D, on the sixth string,

144
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,990
and I end up with this,

145
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,150
I don't necessarily have to start with the pinky,

146
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,250
I'm just pivoting that just shows me where my form sets,

147
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,180
I still can't start on this,

148
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,340
would be a D major pentatonic,

149
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:48,520
also B minor pentatonic.

150
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,840
Let's do one more,

151
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,990
let's do it F major pentatonic,

152
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,010
well, F major, pivoting off of my pinky,

153
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,810
well, I can't do F down there,

154
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,830
that gets me out of range,

155
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,910
so I've got to go high,

156
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,020
so it be this.

157
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,450
Now, I would encourage you to go through all these pentatonic forms,

158
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,170
this first one,

159
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,240
and if it takes a while to get,

160
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,100
so I would start low, go through it in one place,

161
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,490
then maybe go through a half step higher,

162
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,670
I want you to get, you need to get the pattern of it, underneath your fingers,

163
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,070
the pattern being one four, first finger, fourth finger, first finger, third finger,

164
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,850
one three, one three, one four, one four,

165
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,460
one four, one three, one three, one three, one four, one four.

166
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,130
Okay, so do it in a bunch of different places,

167
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,270
you do it ascending or descending,

168
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,370
you can play it without hesitating,

169
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,620
play on that metronome, it's good practice for you,

170
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,210
that's the first pentatonic form.

171
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,650
Now there's five,

172
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,540
let me just briefly cover the next one, the next few,

173
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,700
the second pentatonic form,

174
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,180
if you'll notice, now the diamond is on my second finger

175
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,070
and I've shifted up to the seventh fret,

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,690
so this form will be like this,

177
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:43,630
if I'm playing in C major,

178
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,490
now you may not know what all these notes are up here,

179
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
upon these upper strings,

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
we haven't really covered those yet,

181
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,350
that's okay, that's the beauty, that's the beautiful thing about patterns finger patterns now.

182
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,830
So guitar playing is music and knowing all of the notes

183
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,230
and you need to understand that we've talked a good deal about that,

184
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,060
now I'm going to talk about patterns,

185
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,010
a lot of it is just finger patterns,

186
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,350
you can do little finger patterns to get the sound that you want,

187
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,650
you may not necessarily know what note your playing,

188
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,790
you should know,

189
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,940
but at this point, I want you to get used to doing the pattern of it,

190
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,810
you can also say the scale with it,

191
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:29,160
C D E G A C D E G A C D,

192
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,190
the goal is to learn all of the neck of your guitar,

193
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,720
it may seem unknowable,

194
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,700
I remember sitting in school thinking,

195
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,890
there's no way I could learn this whole neck,

196
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,890
pentatonic scales is what solved that problem for me,

197
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,380
and I'll talk more about that in the guitar tips section,

198
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,840
in you know a little bit, in the.

199
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,880
Let's go through pentatonic form three,

200
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,900
now, I've got my second finger upon this D,

201
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,600
now you'll notice my minor root is down here

202
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,840
on the third, excuse me on the fourth string,

203
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,520
no wait a minute, my minor root on the fifth string with my pinky,

204
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,770
okay, my major root is with my second finger on the third, on the fourth string,

205
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,690
so you'll notice how they're always swapping around,

206
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,620
so you gotta keep keep keep them straight in your mind,

207
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:25,610
this is the third one.

208
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,820
Okay, let's talk over that fourth form,

209
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,740
okay, starts up here on this E,

210
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,300
let's go through it,

211
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,590
back down,

212
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,870
on, leave to work on on your own time.

213
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,430
Let me show you the fifth form,

214
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,640
now I could do it way up here at the fourteenth fret,

215
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,780
but that's not what I want to do,

216
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,810
I'm going to jump down and transpose it down here to the second fret,

217
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,210
where it's a little bit more comfortable to play at,

218
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:15,100
okay, so the last form, the fifth form is like this.

219
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:30,050
There are five different ways I can play those scales,

220
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,700
all you need to do is learn these five forms,

221
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,270
they may seem big and and intimidating at first,

222
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,030
if it's five forms, it's not an unknowable amount of information,

223
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,860
it's five finger patterns,

224
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,950
you do about a hundred times and you got them,

225
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,670
so it just takes a little bit of a leg work to get them underneath your fingers,

226
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,230
once you get them underneath your fingers,

227
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,820
know how to pivot off of them,

228
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,090
you're able to play in any key major or minor.

229
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,470
Okay, so I'm going to show you a couple of the common pentatonic patterns that guys use,

230
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,050
okay, that you can incorporate into your soloing,

231
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,550
okay, first one is,

232
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm going to go back to our first position A minor pentatonic form

233
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,370
and I'm going to go in groups of four,

234
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,760
what do I mean by that,

235
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,360
well, here we go,

236
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,810
it'd be like one two three four

237
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,420
and then I go back down to the C,

238
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,680
and then I go up four from it,

239
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,390
go go the next note D

240
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,370
and I go up four from it,

241
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,460
E, four from it and so on.

242
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,940
When I get to the top,

243
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,470
let me just do it ascending first,

244
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,630
and you can hear what sounds like.

245
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,160
Good, okay, now I'm gonna do it descending,

246
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,510
C A G A,

247
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,520
I go back up to the A, go down four, from it.

248
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:22,130
Okay, that's the first form, the first pattern that we're gonna talk about,

249
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,690
the next one we're gonna talk about,

250
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,260
as we go up in groups of three,

251
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,730
we've gone up in groups of four,

252
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,410
now I'm going to go up in groups of three,

253
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:40,120
so I would go like, one two three, one two three,

254
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,530
now go descending.

255
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,180
Okay, going up in groups of four,

256
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,560
going up in groups of three.

257
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,940
Okay, now here's a third one that I like to use

258
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,950
and I'm going up in pairs,

259
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,970
three, three pairs each,

260
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,110
I don't know how to explain that,

261
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,610
well, I'm doing three pairs each,

262
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,320
let me show you and maybe you can get the idea,

263
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,490
one four, one three, one three,

264
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,840
that would be like the first,

265
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,790
triplet of pairs,

266
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,870
then I go one string down and do three more

267
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,040
and go back one string and do three pairs,

268
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,120
back one string, do the next,

269
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,700
let me do that, from the beginning again,

270
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,630
it's one set of three, two sets of three,

271
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,700
I can do this in reverse descending.

272
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:08,920
Okay, it does it takes a little bit of speeding up,

273
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,020
okay, a little distortion on that, maybe a little bit of delay,

274
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:22,400
crank it down here,

275
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,710
a, try again,

276
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:37,970
okay, so you end up getting some real cool sounds from those,

277
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,680
okay, now in order to hear what sound you're going for,

278
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,210
we're going to train our ear a little bit

279
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,620
and we're going to do that in the next section,

280
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,430
so I'll see you there.

281
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,070
Okay, before we delve into the ear training stuff,

282
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,080
let's talk about some guitar tips

283
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,060
on how to learn these scales,

284
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,590
now it's going to take you a while,

285
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,130
it took me about three months to get these scales down,

286
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,310
where I could play him in every key in any place on the neck,

287
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,050
so it's gonna take a while,

288
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,700
but it is well worth it,

289
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,620
that time that I spent,

290
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,460
taking these scales doing them every day,

291
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,050
not like I spent ten hours a day,

292
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,450
I hear these guys spend ten hours a day practicing,

293
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,740
that's great for them,

294
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,080
I mean, I get a little bit when I can,

295
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,430
I practice when I need to

296
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,900
and when I can do it,

297
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,780
but every day I would try and carve out a little bit of time

298
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,640
and I did these pentatonic scales,

299
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,290
and I didn't get it the first week,

300
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,760
I didn't get the second week,

301
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,370
but after slowly, slowly, slowly,

302
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,520
I got that skill of connecting these scales together

303
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,670
and that changed my whole dynamic of playing,

304
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,000
it's well worth to put the effort into it.

305
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,170
Okay, so what do I mean by connecting these scales together,

306
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,910
well, as you can see by the different forms,

307
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,760
where one form ends, another form starts,

308
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,420
so they kind of fit together like puzzle pieces on your guitar,

309
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,920
if you can think about it that way,

310
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,650
where one side of a pattern,

311
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,330
the first form, let's say,

312
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,310
well, these last, that's actually the one side of the next pattern,

313
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,030
sorry, see how that works

314
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,330
and the next one is the one side of the previous pattern,

315
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,640
so they fit together like jigsaw pieces,

316
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,880
okay, jigsaw puzzle pieces,

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,410
okay, now knowing this, we can then connect them together,

318
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,100
so one of the most helpful exercises that I started doing,

319
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,290
once you get all these forms down

320
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,390
is you start connecting these together,

321
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,050
so let's say, I'm starting,

322
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,890
what do I mean by that,

323
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,200
I'll ascend in one form

324
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,540
and switch to the next form and descend,

325
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:48,340
like this,

326
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,870
then I'll go up to the next form and descend,

327
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:08,330
and then I'll go shift up to the next form and go back up again,

328
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:18,110
shift up to next form, go down,,

329
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,780
shift up to next form, go down, let's go down,

330
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,400
then end up back where I started again.

331
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,440
Okay, so if I put all those together,

332
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:44,240
it would sound something like this.

333
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:49,370
Now takes a little bit to get the finger pattern, part of that down,

334
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,390
but once you do,

335
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,710
I can now solo using pentatonic anywhere on the neck,

336
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,820
if I want to go high I can go high,

337
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,340
I've got a pentatonic form that will take me there,

338
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,770
if I want to stay low, I've got a pentatonic form,

339
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,010
I know which notes are safe for me to land on,

340
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,940
if I want, if I want to think about soloing in a finger pattern way,

341
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,880
rather than using scales and theory,

342
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,230
we ideally want to use both,

343
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,120
but if I want to use a finger pattern way,

344
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,300
I know which notes are safe for me to land on

345
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,370
by these pentatonic forms, that are on that.

346
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,930
Let's do it, let's say if I'm in F minor,

347
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,040
okay.

348
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,890
Okay, now I'm in F minor,

349
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,210
I can solo anywhere on the neck

350
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,770
and F minor I've got little pictures,

351
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,020
even though I may not know exactly what those notes are,

352
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,580
I've got little pictures of patterns,

353
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,960
that I can use anywhere on the neck

354
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,390
and that's a big key to do it,

355
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,220
so put some effort into it,

356
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,170
connect these scales together,

357
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,080
keeping in mind which ones are major, which ones are minor,

358
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,490
you'll learn how to dance around on them

359
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,070
and pentatonic will take you a good long way in your soloing.

360
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,140
Now, let's talk about some ear training things,

361
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,690
we have not talked about ear training so far,

362
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,010
so let's kind of get into it,

363
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,840
what ear training is,

364
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,920
is I want to not just be playing patterns on my guitar,

365
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,760
when I'm soloing,

366
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,810
I want to actually hear music idea, musical ideas in my head

367
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,140
and be able to play them through my guitar.

368
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,430
Okay, one of the greatest quotes I've ever heard was,

369
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,600
in your head,

370
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,480
it's by Chris Proctor, a great guitarist said,

371
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,180
in your head is every musical idea you've ever heard,

372
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,010
but your fingers will only do what they've been trained to do,

373
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,700
so you need to,

374
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,650
we're working on training our fingers,

375
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,090
so just as we hear in our head,

376
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,710
it takes a little bit of sitting on our bed trying to figure out that [],

377
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,500
so when we need to rip it out, we can play it,

378
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,210
so we're going to practice some ear training things

379
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,040
to talk about some simple different ways,

380
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,840
we're going to start on that first pentatonic form,

381
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm going to play a simple idea,

382
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,930
and you try and play it back to me,

383
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,960
we're using that first, first pentatonic form in A minor,

384
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,660
I'm gonna play some simple ideas,

385
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,240
let's, let's click on our metronome here,

386
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,660
I'm gonna play some simple ideas

387
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,360
and you try and play them back to me, okay?

388
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,360
I'm gonna start on this low A,

389
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,590
we'll get start real simple,

390
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,420
ready, go, one two three four,

391
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,770
now you play that note,

392
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,640
what about this,

393
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,030
you play a note,

394
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,560
now you play that,

395
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,040
what about this,

396
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,080
what about this,

397
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,790
trying to get a little bit,

398
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,200
what about,

399
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,320
let's do that one again,

400
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,240
kind of slid into a little bit there,

401
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,700
now you try and play.

402
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,170
Good, see how that works,

403
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,870
simple ear training exercises like that,

404
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,090
we'll do more, when we get to the workshop time,

405
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,690
try and pick out little melodic ideas

406
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,880
and try and figure them out on your guitar,

407
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,380
hunt and peck form

408
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,450
until you can actually get them,

409
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,640
then do them do another key

410
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,720
try and transpose

411
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,870
and try and do an octave lower an octave higher,

412
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,100
a different place on the neck,

413
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,080
that's how you train your ear

414
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,180
to when you hear an idea in your head

415
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,980
to be able to play it through your fingers,

416
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,960
it's a little bit of trial and error

417
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,790
and doing simple things like that,

418
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,660
you hear a note, you try and play,

419
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,740
you hear an idea,

420
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,550
maybe you hear a phrase off the radio off the song that you like,

421
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,410
get your guitar and try and figure out what that was,

422
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,310
try and play it,

423
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,170
it's got a lot of trial and error at first,

424
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:21,130
but eventually you'll start picking the right notes more and more of the time

425
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,600
and that's what it's all about.

426
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,940
Okay, your assignment for this week is

427
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,820
to practice all the pentatonic forms that we have in the book,

428
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,780
there's five of them,

429
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,340
don't just do the first one,

430
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,990
do these other four as well.

431
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,770
Okay, very on the neck where you're placing these pentatonic forms,

432
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,810
take them ascending, take them descending,

433
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,250
and for extra credit,

434
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,690
if you really want to get him down,

435
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,270
do that exercise I talked about in the guitar tips,

436
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,330
connect them all together go ascending and descending,

437
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,780
do it in every key all over the neck,

438
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,100
there's only 12 keys,

439
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,830
wow, it's a big assignment, I know it is,

440
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,520
but it will help you learn the entire neck of your instrument,

441
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,760
be thinking about what notes they are,

442
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,170
try and say and play them,

443
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,250
while you're doing it,

444
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,460
it's very difficult at first,

445
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,330
as you get it,

446
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,880
you will learn and master this whole part of the neck

447
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,990
with being able to solo

448
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,640
and it's a great thing to try and do,

449
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,770
so I'll see you at the workshop time.

450
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,710
Okay, welcome to the workshop time,

451
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,030
here's where we get it all done at,

452
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,920
we're going to talk about the pentatonic forms,

453
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,870
we're going to go over that first one first,

454
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,460
that A minor pentatonic,

455
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,470
I'm going to put on my handy [] metronome,

456
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,310
started nice and slow.

457
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,020
We're going at first form,

458
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,870
A minor or C major pentatonic,

459
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,100
depending on how you want to look at it,

460
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,670
here we go, one two, ready go,

461
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:59,290
let's go down,

462
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:23,360
let's do it again, one two, you know what to do.

463
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
Great, now let's do it,

464
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,620
let's say if I wanted to do it in a G minor,

465
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,430
where I need to put my first finger on that third fret G

466
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,630
and do the same thing again,

467
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,400
let's speed it up a little bit,

468
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:53,230
ready, go,

469
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,190
what about C minor,

470
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,260
C minor, find it,

471
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:15,850
that eight fret, ready, go.

472
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:21,790
Okay, now let's try a different exercise,

473
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,010
we're gonna do that first position,

474
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,610
we're going to do that first form said we're going to do it down in the first position

475
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,010
and let me click on a little bit of distortion

476
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,480
just to give us a different sound,

477
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,930
and we're going to do this,

478
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,660
well, I'll explain along as we go,

479
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,600
start down here at the F minor pentatonic,

480
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,820
I'm gonna do it,

481
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,670
ascending and descending

482
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,350
and then we're going to shift up a half step,

483
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:56,740
ready, go,

484
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,070
I don't know why this wasn't working right,

485
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,720
I don't have my metronome going,

486
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,270
there we go, let's speed it up just a little bit,

487
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:16,680
okay, F minor, ready go,

488
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,800
let's shift up a half step,

489
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:43,090
up a half step,

490
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,960
let's go up half step now

491
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,210
and we're gonna descend, a half step up,

492
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,120
so we're gonna go down this time,

493
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,310
up,

494
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,560
up.

495
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,430
Good, all right, now let's do the other second pentatonic form,

496
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,320
okay, start on a C major,

497
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,540
so this is up here at the seventh fret,

498
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,250
your second finger at the eighth fret,

499
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,930
but the position is seventh position,

500
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:37,200
ready, go,

501
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:44,400
what I wanted to play a G major pentatonic in that second form,

502
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,540
where would you need to go,

503
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,470
well, the pivot notes on that second finger,

504
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,030
so I put my second finger on that G

505
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,720
and I'm ready to go,

506
00:30:51,110 --> 00:31:06,680
ready play,

507
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,030
let's go back

508
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,670
and let's do some of those pentatonic patterns

509
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,260
that we talked about in the first part.

510
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,480
Okay, so let's go back to our A minor pentatonic first position

511
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,120
and we're going to do going up by fours,

512
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,250
going up four notes at a time,

513
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,780
ready play.

514
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,810
Okay, let's crank it up a little bit,

515
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,610
we're going to start right where we stopped off

516
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:54,310
and then we're gonna go back down using four, four to a pattern,

517
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:01,570
ready, go.

518
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,280
Now, let's do the pattern with three,

519
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,450
okay, let's go up to, let's say a C minor pentatonic,

520
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,850
we're going to go up in thirds or three to a set,

521
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:41,550
ready, go,

522
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,080
okay, just for fun,

523
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,290
let's crank it way up and do the same thing again,

524
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,150
three to, three to a set,

525
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,170
one, ready go.

526
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,550
Great, okay, last thing I want to cover on our workshop time is,

527
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,170
we're going to connect those scales together,

528
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,530
so let's start down,

529
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,720
let's start down here F minor,

530
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,850
which would be Ab major

531
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,650
and we're going to connect these scales together,

532
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,200
ascending and descending all over the length of the neck.

533
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,450
Okay, let's slow it down a little bit,

534
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:33,960
okay, one two, ready go,

535
00:33:34,980 --> 00:34:06,900
now shift up in the next form, come down,.

536
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,310
Great, okay, that gives you something to practice on,

537
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,450
I would encourage you to work a little bit more on your own time

538
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,250
to get the things you need to get down.

539
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,890
Okay, so that's a bit of practice on pentatonics,

540
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,530
pentatonics is going to change the way that you play,

541
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,880
just like a changed man

542
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,920
and a whole other dimension to what you're doing,

543
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,080
so we'll see you next time.
