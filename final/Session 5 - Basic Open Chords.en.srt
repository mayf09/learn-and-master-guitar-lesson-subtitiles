00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,150
Hi, welcome to learn and master guitar,

2
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,640
on this session, we're gonna talk about chords,

3
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,150
we're going to learn about what chords are the basic chords,

4
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,790
what chords are open chords and bar chords

5
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,370
and the chords that every guitarist who calls himself a guitarist needs to know certain chords

6
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,780
and that's we're going to talk about today,

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,190
the intro to all of that,

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,470
we can do some songs involving chords,

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,000
in our guitar tips section,

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,630
we're going to talk about sounding your best when playing chords,

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,310
a little bit about strumming that sort of thing.

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,450
So I'll see you there.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,360
Okay, now the first thing you want to think of when you're doing chords is

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,850
going to make sure review our hand position,

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,920
we talked about hand position at the very beginning,

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,910
let's kind of review,

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,500
what a good hand position should be.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,850
For we've got a good pick position right here,

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,890
we're holding our pick nice and strong,

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,700
we don't want to hold it too loose,

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,600
if we hold it too loose,

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,130
it just doesn't work well with chords,

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,940
so we want to hold up, hold a pick with a little bit of strength in it.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,620
Okay, on our left hand,

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,290
we want to make sure that when we're playing these chords,

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,070
that our hand is in a good balanced position,

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,600
our wrist is down,

28
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,640
we've got a little bit of air space here,

29
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm gonna have my thumb and my wrist way up like this,

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,140
we'll come all the way down like this,

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,780
bring that wrist out,

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,180
now you don't need to brace when you're doing chords,

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,410
we've talked about brace soon,

34
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,730
that was good, we're doing single notes

35
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,010
and we had to figure out which string we need to play,

36
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,660
it doesn't work that way with chords,

37
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,840
chords go ahead and [] your fingers underneath your hand

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,950
and we'll just do it,

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,810
without bracing,

40
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,790
that's what we need to do when we get into strumming.

41
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,810
Okay, the chords, we're going to be talking about are open chords,

42
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,760
what open chords are,

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,840
open is telling you that there is an open string involved in the chord,

44
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,640
okay, later on, we're going to talk about bar chords,

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,370
which are chords that do not have any open strings on them

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,220
and that use one finger to cover more than one string,

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,300
that's a bar,

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,830
these first few that we're going to cover are open chords

49
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,540
and that's the ones we're going to focus on right now,

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,310
so let's talk about the first set of chords.

51
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,820
Now, in this session, we're going to learn three different sets of chords,

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,840
I group them together,

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,370
because really a finger combinations that work well with each other,

54
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,130
so you'll notice some are C, some are D, some are Es,

55
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,010
they kind of go in between different ones,

56
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,170
and it may be a little confusing to keep up with the names,

57
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,800
but I did it to introduce the ones that would be the easiest first,

58
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,140
so here's the first batch of chords that we're going to cover.

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,580
Now, actually I've already kind of snuck in the first four that we need to do,

60
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,820
way back in session two I believe it was,

61
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,470
we covered a C chord,

62
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,480
let's review what a C chord is,

63
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,360
the six string, we don't have anything on it,

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,040
there's an x over that chord block,

65
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,800
fifth string, I've got my third finger,

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
fourth string, I've got my second finger,

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,490
third string is open,

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,070
first finger is C, on that second string,

69
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,210
and the last string is open,

70
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,530
let's play altogether,

71
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,730
each note individually,

72
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,060
make sure they're all sounding clean

73
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,560
and sounding out nice and strong,

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,100
no buzz,

75
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,590
one more time,

76
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,170
now together.

77
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,710
Now, sometimes it may be hard for you to grab a couple of these chords,

78
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,130
if you want to kind of the easy way to do some of these chords

79
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,440
is just to take the bottom half of the chord,

80
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,930
in this one,

81
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,320
it would just be the E, the C and G, the lowest three strings

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,270
and just play those to get you started,

83
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,700
but ideally we want to eventually be able to stretch our hands wide enough

84
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,440
to get that E and C in there,

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,750
doing a full C chord.

86
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,920
Okay, the next chord we learned was a G7,

87
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,480
we move our fingers up one string set here

88
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,010
and down to the first string there,

89
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,800
so I've got my third finger, my second finger,

90
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,930
open string, open string, open string,

91
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,540
and then my first finger on that first string.

92
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,210
Okay, let's go note for note,

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,790
one more time,

94
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,830
now altogether,

95
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,970
that's a G7 chord.

96
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,520
Now, if we put them both together,

97
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,970
we've got a C, we've got a G7.

98
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,480
In the last session, we learned about Am,

99
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,340
which is a five string chord,

100
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,870
we don't play that sixth string,

101
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,920
it's got an x above it,

102
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,080
we have an open A,

103
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,300
second finger on this E,

104
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,670
third finger squeezing up underneath this, on the A,

105
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,380
first finger on the C,

106
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,760
and an open E there,

107
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,290
that's A minor, abbreviation for Am,

108
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,450
okay, five string chord,

109
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,100
let's go through just individual notes,

110
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,980
now, altogether.

111
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,100
Now, E chord is the same chord form,

112
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,990
we just move everybody up a string set,

113
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,420
and it's all use all six strings on an E chord,

114
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,750
individual notes,

115
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,330
all together.

116
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,980
Now, the one new chord that we need to touch on

117
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,790
is a D minor chord, abbreviated Dm,

118
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,790
this is our first four string chord, that we've come across,

119
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,130
doesn't use all six strings or five strings,

120
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,300
this uses just four,

121
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,400
the first two strings have an x [],

122
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,510
so don't play those,

123
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,120
then we have an open D,

124
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,350
second finger on the A,

125
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,800
third finger on that D,

126
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,680
first finger on this F,

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,810
maybe a little awkward,

128
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,730
getting that third finger out there to that D,

129
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,010
if you want to, you could squeeze in your pinky there,

130
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,800
but you might get used to playing it the wrong way,

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,690
so I would really recommend that,

132
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:41,690
you try and stretch that third finger out to catch that,

133
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,680
all together,

134
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,160
be real careful to only play four strings,

135
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,930
it's going to get more and more important, which strings which,

136
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,580
if I add those extra two strings in,

137
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,080
I get these rumbling down there,

138
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,700
which a lot of guitar players do

139
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,660
and it's real sloppy,

140
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,740
doesn't sound too good,

141
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,750
so make sure we know which chords are five string, C and Am,

142
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,870
which chords are six string, G7 and E,

143
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,250
and which chords are four string, with that Dm.

144
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,550
Let's start looking at these basic open chord exercises,

145
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,700
number one let's look at the first exercise,

146
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,770
we're going to go through four Cs,

147
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,710
then it's four beats of rest,

148
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,470
four G7s, four beats of rest,

149
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,700
should be no problem for you.

150
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,130
Ready, play,

151
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,360
and four beats of rest, two three,

152
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,730
G7.

153
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,980
Very good, number two we go between Am and E,

154
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,250
Am, ready, play,

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,520
E, everybody moves up a string set,

156
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,380
ready, play.

157
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,680
Very good, okay, now in the third one,

158
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,270
you'll notice we have eighth notes,

159
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,070
well how do we do eighth notes when we're strumming

160
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,680
or how do eighth notes with chords,

161
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,030
it involves strumming,

162
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,410
let's talk about that for a second.

163
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,590
On my right hand over here,

164
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,810
as I'm coming into play this C,

165
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,540
I come down and I hit my fifth string,

166
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,410
if you can think of,

167
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,410
it's kind of making a little arc as I'm coming around,

168
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,850
now, if you were a kid,

169
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,770
and somebody gave you a guitar,

170
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,720
chances are you'd probably walk up to it go,

171
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,860
everybody does,

172
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,800
now that motion is actually,

173
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,540
pretty close to what you need to be doing,

174
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,540
you need to just grip grip a pick in it a little bit stronger,

175
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,380
but you want your wrist to be loosed to be loose,

176
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,840
it's almost like you're flicking something off of your hand,

177
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,240
that's the that's the motion with your wrist,

178
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,530
if you get it too tight,

179
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,970
it sounds real choppy

180
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,890
and it's not the direction we want to go,

181
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,540
now make sure that your wrist is loose,

182
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,800
you're gripping the pick strong,

183
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,360
but your wrist is still loose.

184
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,940
Let's take a look at three,

185
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,590
if I was doing that C,

186
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,110
down and up, we have to do it nice and steady.

187
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,010
Now I come down with my arc

188
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,420
and when I come back,

189
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,030
I really only hit a couple of them,

190
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,130
you don't try to be accurate on it,

191
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,100
way back then and then suddenly pull out at the last minute,

192
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,330
it doesn't work that way,

193
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,720
just kind of angle the arc of your arm here to go,

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,340
accurate going down,

195
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,710
and then you hit some of them coming up,

196
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,750
accurate going down, some of them coming up.

197
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,940
Okay, number three, let's do that one,

198
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,810
starts on a C,

199
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,890
ready, go,

200
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:50,900
down up, down up, down up, down up,

201
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,500
rest, find that Am,

202
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,610
ready, play,

203
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,990
five string chord again,

204
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,280
try that one again,

205
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,170
go back to that C, two,

206
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,060
ready and C play,

207
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,400
slow and even strums,

208
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,420
Am, find it,

209
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,950
ready, go, now.

210
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,470
Good, now let's skip down to number five,

211
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,390
that gets our Dm chord

212
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,400
and then we're gonna go to G7.

213
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,830
We're slowly combining these different rhythms,

214
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,230
first, we just did quarter notes,

215
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,280
then we did eight notes,

216
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,800
now we're going to quarter notes and eighth notes mixed together,

217
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,080
ready, number five, go,

218
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,170
rest, get ready for that G7,

219
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,510
ready G7.

220
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:13,470
Do it again, Dm ready, go,

221
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,810
G7, two, ready, go.

222
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,890
Good, now let's learn our second batch of chords.

223
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,440
Okay, for the second batch of chords,

224
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:37,300
we're gonna cover the G, D7, Em, and the ever elusive B7,

225
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,580
Okay, so we start out with a G,

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,070
now if you look at your chord diagram,

227
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,040
there's actually two different ways that you can finger this one.

228
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,520
Okay, the more common way is you put your third finger up here on the sixth string,

229
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,310
second finger on the fifth string,

230
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,330
then you have open string, open string, open string,

231
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,010
and then way down at the bottom,

232
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,370
you've got your pinky on that high G,

233
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,290
on that E string, on that first string.

234
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,630
Now, the other way of fingering it is

235
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,860
just switch your fingers around,

236
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,530
I have my second finger on that G,

237
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,210
first finger on the B,

238
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,580
then, open, open, open,

239
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,840
third finger on that G there.

240
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,200
So, either way is right,

241
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:33,590
so you need to find which way is more comfortable for you to play

242
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,140
and it may be in different musical situations,

243
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,090
one may be more preferable than the other,

244
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,550
the next chord is a D7,

245
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,840
back to those D chord,

246
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,610
so that means it's a four string chord,

247
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,220
I don't play these lower two strings,

248
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,640
so we have an open D,

249
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,530
second finger on that A,

250
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,040
first finger on that C,

251
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,850
third finger on this #F on the first string.

252
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,010
Try one more time,

253
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,750
now altogether.

254
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,860
That's a D7,

255
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,350
may be a little tricky getting that third finger underneath there,

256
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,520
you just kind of try,

257
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,450
it takes a while,

258
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,460
if your chords are initially buzzy

259
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,410
and you think, gosh, I'm never gonna get,

260
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,870
it just sounds, it sounds like,

261
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,130
I'm not getting it,

262
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,870
it takes a while, I've found,

263
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,250
in teaching people chords,

264
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,930
it takes a while for them to get it,

265
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,430
some folks get it right off

266
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,500
and it's not a problem of hand strength or anything like that for them,

267
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,190
they just get it,

268
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,040
other folks they have to strengthen up their hands,

269
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,260
their problem is they're not able to push the strings down hard enough to get that,

270
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,350
other folks they just can't find the sweet spot to it,

271
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,540
the chords aren't buzzy,

272
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,990
but it's just I got other fingers that are touching the strings all around them

273
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,690
and I end up with these muted sounds,

274
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,390
so that's why it's important to go one right after the other,

275
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,390
and you may think gosh it just sounds like this

276
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,470
and it's not gonna get any better,

277
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,810
but I have not found that to be true,

278
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,500
I've worked with folks with all kinds of different hands, all kinds of different fingers,

279
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,470
in in hand strength issues

280
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,510
and I have found that in general,

281
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,880
they're able to get it with a little bit of practice,

282
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,640
it takes a while to find the sweet spot of where to put your fingers

283
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,280
to get it all to sound right,

284
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,570
but keep working at it,

285
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,820
it may not come in a few days,

286
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,750
maybe a week or two,

287
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,460
before you actually get them to open up,

288
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,830
but once you get them to open up,

289
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,490
they'll be there,

290
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,670
the next one is an Em.

291
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,880
E chord, all six strings,

292
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,530
this one is pretty easy,

293
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,520
we have open E,

294
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,410
second finger on that B,

295
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,660
third finger on that E,

296
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,740
then the rest of them open,

297
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,210
that's an Em.

298
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,790
Now, B7 is the last one in this batch,

299
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,810
second finger on the fifth string,

300
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,150
five string chord, don't play that sixth string,

301
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,600
first finger on that #D,

302
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,350
third finger on that A,

303
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,030
open B,

304
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,040
and pinky on that #F,

305
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,770
now this one may take a little practice

306
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,320
of getting them all to sound out clearly,

307
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,820
a lot of times, you'll find that that #D won't come out real good,

308
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,160
because this finger, your second finger,

309
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,890
he's got his little [], sitting on the string underneath him

310
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,210
and it doesn't, it doesn't let him play.

311
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,760
There's really only two problems, why note doesn't sound,

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,980
it's either it doesn't have enough pressure on it

313
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,390
or somebody's in the way.

314
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,840
So if you've got one notes like that

315
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,210
and you think you've got enough pressure on it,

316
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,210
look and see if somebody is now sitting on that note,

317
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,200
one of your other fingers

318
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,140
and that will help your B7.

319
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,240
Let's go through some exercises with these,

320
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,420
this would be your basic open chord exercises too.

321
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,250
Okay, start off with number one, starts on that G chord.

322
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,550
Ready, six string chord,

323
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,220
loose wrist, holding my pick strong,

324
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,060
ready, go,

325
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,520
a few beats to find that D7,

326
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,770
only four string chord, be careful,

327
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,620
if you need to look at your hand while you're playing,

328
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,600
make sure you're getting the right number of strings,

329
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,350
please do so.

330
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,140
Let's do number two,

331
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,700
C, we got some down and ups, having some eighth notes,

332
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:47,470
ready, go, down up, down up, down up, down up,

333
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,790
D7, two three,

334
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,360
or give you second to find it,

335
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,190
good.

336
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,510
Number three, we have at B7,

337
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,470
three, jumping down to an Em,

338
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,930
I gave you hard and then the easy one comes.

339
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,170
Great, so let's go to the last and third batch of chords.

340
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,570
Okay, now let's talk about the third set of chords,

341
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,690
okay, we get it the first one we come across is a D,

342
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,180
we've already done a Dm, D7,

343
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,120
now we are to the top of that chord family, the D,

344
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,730
again all the D chords are four string chords,

345
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,620
we have open D,

346
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:47,850
now you put your first finger on this third string A,

347
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,300
curve your third finger over to catch this second string D

348
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,550
and then your second finger,

349
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,270
kind of squeezes up underneath there, on that first string to catch that #F,

350
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,760
okay, let's do it together,

351
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,050
one more time,

352
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,880
all in one strum,

353
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:20,390
one more time, for good measure.

354
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,580
Next we come across is a C7,

355
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,900
we've already done the C,

356
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,630
remember what a C was like here,

357
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,790
only thing different about a C7 is,

358
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,960
I put my pinky down on that third string on the third fret,

359
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,800
that's a C7.

360
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
Let me go slow, each individual note,

361
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,960
now, if [] back a little bit too much with my wrist,

362
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,670
I may get some of the notes not coming out right,

363
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,320
bring that wrist down,

364
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,250
to where they can all come out properly.

365
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,920
Next one is an A,

366
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,000
here's another five string chord,

367
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,360
open A

368
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,370
and then there's the tricky thing about this one,

369
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,770
as I've got everybody's on that second fret,

370
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,820
on the fourth, third and second string,

371
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,020
so how do we do that,

372
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,210
well, different guys do different ways,

373
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,390
here's what I'll give you two different ways,

374
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,200
here's the first way,

375
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,900
use your second third and fourth finger

376
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,960
and you just squeeze them all up underneath there together,

377
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,200
okay, now, sometimes they won't even fit

378
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,020
and so you have to really kind of move your hand around

379
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,760
or you may have some of that sound like that,

380
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,950
squeeze them real in their type,

381
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,040
see if you can't open that up a little bit,

382
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,980
now that's kind of the official way to play,

383
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,870
sometimes in the heat of battle,

384
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:56,340
you may take your first finger and bar this fourth, the third and the second string,

385
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,220
now a lot of guys do that,

386
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,450
there's one problem with that

387
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,860
and it's on the first string,

388
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,870
there it is,

389
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,130
there's no way, unless you're you're double jointed,

390
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,930
that you can get your first finger to bar all three of notes

391
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,540
and then invert to get off that last one,

392
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,000
so it's good when you're on a rare back

393
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,980
and just kind of get the bottom four strings of it,

394
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,080
but if you want to get the full chord,

395
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,160
you really gotta work on getting these fingers to squeeze all up in together.

396
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,690
Okay, A7, it's pretty easy,

397
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,130
we just take our A,

398
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,040
we move our third finger down and take our pinky out of the picture,

399
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,990
so we have open A,

400
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,210
second finger on that fourth string,

401
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,550
open G,

402
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,080
make sure you can hear that open G,

403
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,190
make sure that second finger, make sure his rear end isn't sitting on that string

404
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,160
and third finger squeezing up underneath there, that's #C,

405
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,290
and open.

406
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,090
Very good, the last one we're going to cover is E,

407
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,220
all six strings on that E,

408
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,370
it's a E7, excuse me,

409
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,600
go ahead form it

410
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
by making your E that we learned earlier,

411
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,710
remember that,

412
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,750
now just take your third finger off,

413
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,840
if we take our third finger off,

414
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,700
we're just left with our second and our first,

415
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,450
and that's in E7.

416
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,360
Of course getting easier, aren't they,

417
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,420
probably pretty thankful about that by right about now.

418
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,310
That's a E7,

419
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,870
let's go through a couple of these exercises,

420
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,940
basic open chord exercises number, basic chord exercises three,

421
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,500
we're going to start with the first one,

422
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,090
okay, starts on that D.

423
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,900
Ready, play,

424
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,550
four string chord,

425
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,220
give a second to find this A

426
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,500
and squeeze all those fingers on that second fret,

427
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,430
go,

428
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,490
one more time to the D,

429
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:17,220
ready play, back to A, two three four.

430
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,050
Very good.

431
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,760
Okay, let's skip down a little bit,

432
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,880
let's go down to, let's say number five,

433
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,950
okay, that one starts on a G,

434
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,350
now I'm starting to really get a little more complex

435
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:39,300
with the chords, the quarter notes and the eighth notes of the chords,

436
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,640
okay, you have to pay attention to your rhythm a little bit,

437
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,840
starts on a G,

438
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,830
we'll go nice and slow,

439
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,230
ready, go,

440
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,080
rest, rest,

441
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,050
Em, rest,

442
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,250
C7, rest,

443
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,730
D7, rest,

444
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,110
on those down ups were accurate coming down

445
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,600
and we just had a couple of them coming up.

446
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,230
Let's do number, what was that number five, let's do number five again,

447
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,220
ready, go,

448
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,710
rest rest,

449
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,380
Em, rest,

450
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,420
C7, rest,

451
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,330
D7, rest.

452
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,340
Now you may have a problem with some of your chords,

453
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,370
it takes a little bit longer for you to actually form the chord

454
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,200
and so you're kind of hesitating in between them,

455
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,500
you may do the first G

456
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,650
and then it kind of takes a minute to get that Em,

457
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,110
the more you practice that, the quicker that transition will get,

458
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,360
where you change those chords is important

459
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,830
and we'll talk about that in the next section.

460
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,630
For our guitar tips section,

461
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,840
we're going to talk about two important concepts relating to chords,

462
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,800
first of them is changing chords at the right time,

463
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,620
this is very very important,

464
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,020
a lot of times you're practicing these chord changes,

465
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,880
you're very worried about

466
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,660
getting making sure that all of these notes are coming out at the right time

467
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,490
and that you're playing them enough times

468
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,050
and then it's time to play that next quarter

469
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,000
and you've got to think about it there for a second.

470
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,170
And then you gotta move on,

471
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,210
okay, when you're actually playing a song,

472
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,980
you gotta keep those chords in the right spots

473
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,120
or the song doesn't work.

474
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,430
So it's better for you to get through

475
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,520
and maybe chop off a couple of beats of that first chord

476
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,790
in order to land that second chord at the right time,

477
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
it's better to do that

478
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,770
than to catch every last drop of that first chord and miss the second chord,

479
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,630
I'd rather you cut off the first one,

480
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,830
give yourself a little time

481
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,900
to get what you need, where you need to get,

482
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,640
so that when it's time for that second chord,

483
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,200
when that split second comes by,

484
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,600
you're ready to land on that second chord.

485
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,650
Okay, changing chords at the proper time is very very important.

486
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,250
Next thing I want to talk about is an Em11,

487
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,800
now you're probably going, what is an Em11,

488
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,740
well, we'll learn what Em11 is in a few sessions,

489
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:24,200
but for right now you need to know what this chord is

490
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,820
and never to do it,

491
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,130
when you're going through a chord progression,

492
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,280
let's say I'm going from a G, let's say to a C,

493
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,210
so I'm gonna play four Gs, then I'm gonna do four Cs,

494
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,450
now as you're just starting off in chords,

495
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,310
you may be tempted to do this,

496
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,540
listen real carefully,

497
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,060
You hear how you have,

498
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,190
right in between when I'm changing chords,

499
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,560
I still have one strum left

500
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,470
and I think, well, I can't make it and change chords at the right time,

501
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,240
so I just let that strum go

502
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,670
as my fingers are off the fret board over here

503
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,480
and you end up with Em11,

504
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,650
so you are not to play Em11 within between chords,

505
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,740
grab those chords as much as you can,

506
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,150
hang onto it, hang onto it

507
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,620
and then change really really quickly between the two,

508
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:35,190
so that you don't have that extra superfluous Em11 in the middle of everything,

509
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,650
Okay, so if I'm speeding up a chord progression,

510
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,800
maybe I'm doing something,

511
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,110
which is a G, a C, a D7 and a G,

512
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,570
well just to make sure you're changing chords,

513
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,340
you're not throwing in that open strum,

514
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,070
as you're changing chords,

515
00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:01,880
which would sound something like this,

516
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,580
real common guitar players do,

517
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,090
just because we're human and we like to be sloppy sometimes,

518
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,950
so try and avoid doing that,

519
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,110
change those chords at exactly the proper time,

520
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,350
so that when the chord changed, the song is going by,

521
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,510
that you're playing at the right chord at the right time.

522
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,050
Okay, let's talk about your assignment for this session,

523
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,150
your assignment for this session is,

524
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,720
I want you to do all of the basic chord exercises in your book,

525
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,290
which is basic exercises, one two and three.

526
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,040
Okay, we're also going to,

527
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,000
there's basic chord songs in your book as, songs in your book as well,

528
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,500
and I'd like for you to do those,

529
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,390
play through with the notes,

530
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,520
now that you've learned all your first position notes,

531
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,470
remember notes a couple of sessions back,

532
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,300
now we've got chords with them,

533
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,980
we're going to tie the two together.

534
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,370
Okay, so play the notes through one time,

535
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,690
play the chords through one time.

536
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,440
Okay, next thing is the workshop,

537
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,160
I'll see you there.

538
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,510
Okay, welcome to the workshop time,

539
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,290
here we're gonna get some good workouts on the chords that we've learned,

540
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,150
let's review the chords that we've covered so far.

541
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,470
Now I'm not going to say them,

542
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,980
we aren't going to go through them, in the, in the order that we did before,

543
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,020
I'm going to group them into families.

544
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,550
Okay, so the first two we're going to cover is the C and the C7,

545
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,230
here's a C chord,

546
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,140
then for C7, all I have to do is put my pinky down,

547
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,800
I want you to kind of start seeing how these all relate together,

548
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,430
let's play C, C7.

549
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,470
Next is the D family,

550
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,690
let's play D,

551
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,410

557
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,640
Em, take that first finger off,

558
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,320
put that first finger back on, take the third finger off, for E7.

559
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,080
Do those again,

Okay, now let's look at some of our songs,

713
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,840
the first song to look at is Morning Has Broken,

714
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,950
okay, first thing we're gonna do is, is the notes,

715
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,000
do the notes first,

716
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,790
okay, starts on it, starts on that C, on the fifth string,

717
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,710
we'll go through one time slow

718
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,120
and we'll do one time fast,

719
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,760
since three four times, so three beats per measure,

720
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,590
here we go, starts on that C,

721
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,480
ready, go,

722
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,430
two three,

723
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,220
two three,

724
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:07,900
two three,

725
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,670
two three,

726
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:23,370
go, two three,

727
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:28,350
two three,

728
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,750
two three,

729
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,330
two three.

730
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,400
Very good,

731
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,290
okay, now one more time with the notes

732
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,640
a little bit faster this time.

733
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:58,120
One, ready, go.

734
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,340
Okay great,

735
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,900
now let's take a look at the chords,

736
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,790
starts off with the C chord,

737
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:41,020
okay, we're just gonna do a chord for each measure,

738
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,000
okay, don't worry about doing strums just yet,

739
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,770
if you want to strum along with each beat, that's fine,

740
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,780
we're going to do whole notes, that's fine too,

741
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,310
let's just do whole notes for now.

742
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,660
Okay, starts out on a C chord,

743
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,440
now if there's a measure that's blank,

744
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,080
you just keep repeating the chord of the previous measure,

745
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:58,920
that's how that works,

746
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,870
it doesn't change until the actual chord change.

747
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,940
Here we go, starts on that C,

748
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,140
I'll count you off,

749
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,780
one, ready, go,

750
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,120
Dm,

751
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,690
now to a G,

752
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,400
to a Dm,

753
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,970
to a C,

754
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,730
here would be another C,

755
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,190
Em,

756
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,100
Am,

757
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,860
D7,

758
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,960
G,

759
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:33,860
C,

760
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,650
Dm,

761
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:40,370
another Dm,

762
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,740
C,

763
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,060
Am,

764
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,500
D,

765
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,400
G,

766
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,270
G7 here,

767
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,420
C,

768
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,260
Very good,

769
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,290
okay, the last thing we're gonna do here is America The Beautiful,

770
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,880
we're going to start off with our notes

771
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,380
and then we're gonna go to chords later,

772
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,670
so take a look at it,

773
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,110
let's do the notes first,

774
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,190
nice and slow,

775
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,810
we have a pickup note on that D,

776
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,320
ready play,

777
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:30,580
#F,

778
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,330
two three,

779
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,830
here comes a #G, first finger,

780
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,960
two three,

781
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:56,810
#F here,

782
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,940
two three,

783
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,220
two three.

784
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,090
Very good, that one is a good workout on the dotted quarter note,

785
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,820
we haven't really worked too much with a dotted quarter note,

786
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,990
gets a beat and a half

787
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,940
and it's almost always followed by another eighth note,

788
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,750
is that would be,

789
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,790
dotted quarter, eighth quarter, okay.

790
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,740
Let's do the chords this time, okay,

791
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,360
it's in four four time,

792
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,730
one, I'll catch you off, two,

793
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,150
ready go,

794
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,970
two three four,

795
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,770
one two three four,

796
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,420
another D7,

797
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,100
now, G,

798
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,860
stay on that G,

799
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:11,970
here comes some quick changes,

800
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:17,630
E7, A7, D7,

801
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,580
back to G,

802
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,460
D and a quick D7,

803
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,100
Am D7,

804
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,660
G,

805
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,370
C,

806
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,060
G,

807
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,330
Am, D7,

808
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:54,030
G, two three four.

809
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,740
As you rehearse these more,

810
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,260
you can start adding more beats into it,

811
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:59,940
maybe chords with every beat

812
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,070
rather than just doing whole note like we did there,

813
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,210
but we've got to start somewhere,

814
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,320
so we start off with whole notes.

815
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,150
So, thanks, and we will see you next time.
