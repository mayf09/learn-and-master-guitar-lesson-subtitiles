101
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,110
0,275 275,440 440,730 1080,1505 1505,1900
When you do jazz stuff

102
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,245

0,195 195,485 805,1050 1050,1140 1140,1275
one here that I use

104
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,920
0,120 120,225 225,390 390,680

0,290 290,410 410,640 690,980 980,1175
You see, it almost has

106
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:20,550
0,225 225,450 450,630 630,765 765,885
no point on it at

107
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,250

all. It's just such a.|

108
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,100
0,400 960,1340 1340,1580 1580,1685 1685,1790
Round thick and {that's -}

0,135 135,270 270,530
what you need.|

110
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,380

Guitar for jazz guitar playing

0,400 660,995 995,1295 1295,1460 1460,1780
okay, now let's talk about

112
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,260
0,440 440,1055 1055,1250 1250,1385 1385,1550

0,150 150,255 255,375 375,525 525,690
thing that they use a

114
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,070
0,225 225,560 970,1365 1365,1740 1740,2120
lot in jazz chord playing.|

115
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,495
0,335 335,515 515,590 590,680 680,815
Okay, what do I mean

116
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,845
0,150 150,420 420,900 900,1095 1095,1350
by chord melodies? Well, here's

117
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,255
0,195 195,545 775,1050 1050,1230 1230,1410
the idea. {You,have -} your

00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:41,500
0,575
melody.|

119
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,010
0,320 320,545 545,740 740,1040 1040,1130
Your single note melody up

120
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,820
0,150 150,360 360,540 540,660 660,810
on top. {And,then -} I'm

121
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,645
0,60 60,165 165,300 300,495 495,825
going to try and squeeze

122
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:45,665
0,180 180,405 405,600 600,750 750,1020
in all of the chord

123
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,615
0,395 835,1080 1080,1215 1215,1470 1470,1950
tones for the appropriate chords

124
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:49,685
0,305 445,765 765,1065 1065,1655 1765,2070
underneath that chord melody. Let's

125
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:50,525
0,90 90,165 165,285 285,540 540,840
look at that first example

126
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:51,665
0,180 180,300 300,575 625,885 885,1140
in your {book.,The -} regular

127
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:58,670
0,635 835,1155 1155,1380 1380,1685 6715,7005
melody goes {like,this. -} Okay,

128
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,410
0,150 150,255 255,345 345,465 465,740
that would be a good

129
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,175
0,395 395,665 665,890 890,1180 1350,1595
jazz {little,lick -} there. Now

130
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:01,775
0,90 90,195 195,300 300,405 405,600
if I want to put

131
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,380
0,375 375,635 715,1115
cords underneath it.|

132
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,650
0,275 275,410 410,515 515,650 650,800
I kind of go something

133
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,300
0,150 150,375 375,710 910,1310
like this, ready go.|

134
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,770
0,320 320,500 500,650 650,845 845,1040
Now I just added A

135
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,850
0,165 165,420 420,765 765,1005 1005,1080
C major seventh. We're gonna

136
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,795
0,150 150,330 330,525 525,765 765,945
talk about those forms here

137
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,845
0,90 90,210 210,485 715,960 960,1050
in a second, but I

138
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:15,790
0,135 135,300 300,435 435,660 660,945
added A C major seventh

139
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,780
0,165 165,270 270,420 420,675 675,990
and an e minor seventh

140
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,250
0,350 460,860 940,1200 1200,1335 1335,1470
underneath it to kind of

141
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:18,775
0,120 120,225 225,300 300,405 405,525
give it a little bit

142
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,080
0,120 120,480 480,725 745,1080 1080,1305
of texture underneath. {It,makes -}

143
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,850
0,120 120,195 195,300 300,465 465,770
a little bit more creative.

144
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,105
0,320 320,395 395,470 470,605 605,905
Let's look at that second

145
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:23,060
0,395
example.|

146
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,020
0,400 780,1070 1070,1220 1220,1480 2040,2510
Okay, just the normal melody

147
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,600
0,105 105,270 270,560 580,980 1180,1580
is like this, ready? Go.

148
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,190
0,365 365,575 575,725 725,935 935,1100
{Okay,,so -} now throw some

149
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,300
0,285 285,420 420,690 690,945 945,1110

151
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,220
0,275 275,410 410,545 545,820 870,1100
See how that works. {You,just

152
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,775
0,90 90,195 195,270 270,405 405,555

153
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:43,650
0,150 150,375 375,1115 1525,1770 1770,1875
you're adding chords to the

154
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,735
0,240 240,620 640,945 945,1250 1540,2085
notes and where they appropriately

155

0,255 255,480 480,645 645,935

156
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,645
0,285 285,600 600,900 900,1095 1095,1185
And sometimes you have to

157
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:49,500
0,90 90,210 210,405 405,645 645,855
kind of play around with

158
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,020
0,290 400,900 900,1035 1035,1215 1215,1520
the fingering of your cord.

159
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,290

c {major.,Seventh -} usually goes

161
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,465
0,165 165,285 285,465 465,720 720,885
down to this g, but

162
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:55,260
0,120 120,270 270,465 465,645 645,795
I just needed it down

163
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,505
0,135 135,240 240,500 940,1155 1155,1245
to the e, so I

164
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,330
0,165 165,360 360,540 540,690 690,825
just use it where I

165
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:57,975

down the E I don't

167
00:04:58,815 --> 00:04:59,385
0,105 105,225 225,315 315,420 420,570

0,255 255,405 405,540 540,675 675,915
because they use an awful

297
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:35,790
0,240 240,360 360,555 555,840 840,1385

0,275 275,440 440,530 530,710 710,950
That one's a little tough

315
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,890

0,290 290,515 515,760 810,1210 1290,1690
which you've already been introduced

330
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,715
0,275 275,395 395,500 500,620 620,755
when we were doing our

331
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:31,180
0,195 195,405 405,630 630,965

0,240 240,605 685,1035 1035,1185 1185,1350
different forms. Wouldn't sound as

00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:42,725
0,165 165,345 345,665 1015,1290 1290,1440
great with jazz, but you

342
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,285
0,165 165,345 345,525 525,815 1225,1560

0,90 90,285 285,620 700,1215 1215,1820
a couple more ninth chords.|

347
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,480
0,320 550,945 945,1065 1065,1230 1230,1520
Okay, here's a good one

348
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,455
0,335 335,590 590,755 755,890 890,1145
based off of the fifth

349
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:53,400
0,210 210,330 330,600 600,750 750,945
string and pivoting off the

350
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,250
0,240 240,590 700,1065 1065,1350 1350,1850
fifth string, A C ninth.

351
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,210
0,410 410,605 605,940 1350,1640 1640,1850
Where's that c on that

352
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,355
0,285 285,650 1390,1665 1665,1920 1920,2145

0,210 210,300 300,540 540,825 825,1095
It's just the inside four

354
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,185
0,270 270,390 390,465 465,615 615,735
{strings.,So,I - -} don't play

355
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,390
0,275 565,900 900,1235 1585,1920 1920,2205
the sixth string or the

356
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,700
0,285 285,570 570,920 1990,2220 2220,2310
fifth first string, so an

357
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,395
0,210 210,560 1030,1425 1425,1560 1560,1695
e flat ninth would be

358
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:08,840
0,275
there.|

359
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,990
0,275 275,380 380,470 470,620 620,830
Now {there's -} one off

360
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,730
0,180 180,420 420,780 780,1160 1480,1740
of the sixth string, which

361
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,640
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,950
is an a ninth.|

362
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,690
0,275 275,410 410,530 530,710 710,920
Which is a real pretty

363
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,455
0,195 195,315 315,450 450,630 630,765
chord. {I,use -} this one

364
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:17,885
0,105 105,285 285,605 1945,2220 2220,2430
a lot {too.,Again, -} I'm

365
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:20,360
0,270 270,510 510,840 840,1205 2245,2475
muting that fifth string so

366
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,875
0,105 105,300 300,525 525,830 1270,1515
you can hear him and

367
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:22,910
0,120 120,435 435,630 630,795 795,1035
I don't play the {last,string.,If

368
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,245
0,380 730,975 975,1095 1095,1230 1230,1335
- -} I did, it

369
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,700
0,245 565,825 825,975 975,1200 1200,1455
would end up changing into

370
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,590
0,180 180,570 570,890 1450,1695 1695,1890
a thirteenth court, but that's

371
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,490
0,105 105,380 700,1310 2080,2385 2385,2900
an a ninth, c ninth.|

372
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,675
0,320 320,640 1020,1280 1280,1400 1400,1505
A night and those are

373
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:33,710
0,120 120,285 285,540 540,840 840,1035
just some common forms for

374
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,760
0,260 370,630 630,750 750,915 915,1050
that. {Okay,,now -} let's talk

375
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,050
0,210 210,690 690,855 855,1035 1035,1290
about jazzing up your chord

376
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,295
0,650 730,990 990,1095 1095,1170 1170,1245
{progressions.,Well, -} one of the

377
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:38,525
0,435 435,615 615,765 765,960 960,1230
easiest thing to do is

378
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,610
0,335 445,780 780,1175 1765,1995 1995,2085
add {color,tones. -} So if

379
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,885
0,435 435,690 690,900 900,1050 1050,1275
I'm, if it's A C

380
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,940
0,240 240,390 390,570 570,735 735,1055
chord that I'm looking at,

381
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,705
0,275 275,500 500,740 740,1030 1290,1595
I can always add {a,color

382
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:45,545
0,270 270,510 510,645 645,750 750,840
-} tone. Well, what is

383
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,260
0,120 120,360 360,725 985,1335 1335,1715
a color tone? Color tones

384
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,370
0,290 290,530 530,695 695,815 815,1090
are tones that are added

385
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,240
0,245 245,380 380,700 930,1205 1205,1400
to the chord, still based

386
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,280
0,195 195,300 300,375 375,620 640,1040
off {of,the,major,scale. - - -}

387
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,060
0,245 245,380 380,605 605,1190 1190,1490
So A C triad is

388
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,500
0,320 460,860
c G.|

389
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,185
0,400 420,680 680,905 905,1205 1205,1415
And the major seventh on

390
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:57,025
0,165 165,315 315,450 450,585 585,840
that would be that extra

391
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,255
0,395 565,825 825,930 930,1050 1050,1230
b, one of the color

392
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,200
0,255 255,435 435,585 585,765 765,945
tones, would be like your

0,165 165,360 360,810 810,945 945,1095
up chord progressions is just

0,275 325,630 630,885 885,1155 1155,1455

0,150 150,255 255,345 345,525 525,810

0,150 150,770 1030,1350 1350,1530 1530,1650

0,135 135,300 300,525 525,765 765,930

0,120 120,255 255,390 390,525 525,735

0,135 135,330 330,510 510,720 720,1005

0,255 255,495 495,660 660,795 795,930
Well, remember a couple of

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,340
0,360 360,555 555,720 720,900 900,1110
sessions back? We talked about

0,150 150,710 730,1130 1330,1730
the harmonized major scale.|

0,225 225,435 435,585 585,920 1150,1500
If I'm in c, the

0,330 330,770 790,1110 1110,1320 1320,1610
first chord is c major

436
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,225
0,275 275,500 500,850 1110,1415 1415,1685
C E G, the second

437
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:15,205
0,425 865,1200 1200,1455 1455,1725 1725,1980
chord is D F A,

0,165 165,285 285,450 450,645 645,870
and that ends up being

00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,740
0,225 225,465 465,815 835,1295
A D minor chord.|

0,120 120,225 225,330 330,525 525,765

0,330 330,615 615,720 720,990 990,1445

0,150 150,330 330,570 570,765 765,945
to that key, I just

450
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,285
0,210 210,465 465,800 940,1200 1200,1365

00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,055
0,305 325,725 1195,1455 1455,1650 1650,1770
five in and it'll get

0,135 135,300 300,525 525,720 720,900
me to whatever key I'm

going in.|

454

0,300 300,390 390,465 465,525 525,600
Let's take a look at

455
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,225
0,120 120,390 390,770 1240,1530 1530,1665
that first example. You've got

456
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,095
0,165 165,510 510,660 660,810 810,870
two chords there. You've got

457
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,655
0,150 150,345 345,615 615,995 1225,1560
A C major seventh going

458
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:40,890
0,165 165,270 270,495 495,840 840,1235
into an f major, seventh

459
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:47,485
0,335 335,670 1020,1810 5670,5990 5990,6305
pretty common progression f major

460
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:53,935
0,395 5335,5595 5595,5955 5955,6300 6300,6450
seven now that's, that's pretty

461
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,120
0,300 300,555 555,675 675,870 870,1185
good. {But,we -} can let's

462
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,690
0,90 90,150 150,225 225,345 345,570
see if we can jazz

463
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,430
0,165 165,410 610,1010 1180,1515 1515,1740
it up by using the

464
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,570
0,225 225,560 610,870 870,1005 1005,1140
two, five of the key

465
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,760
0,105 105,270 270,465 465,830
that we're going to.|

466
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,365
0,400 510,785 785,980 980,1250 1250,1505
So the first measure stays

467
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,720
0,195 195,480 480,750 750,990 990,1355
the same, c major seventh,

468
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,440
0,305 305,530 530,740 740,1030 1050,1340
and then, but look, I

469
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,400
0,165 165,315 315,465 465,660 660,960
still have that f major

470
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,930
0,315 315,525 525,795 795,1190 1270,1530
seventh in bar three, but

471
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,950
0,120 120,330 330,585 585,840 840,1020
in bar two I'm adding

472
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,590
0,270 270,590 820,1110 1110,1320 1320,1640
the two and the five.|

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,135
0,350 350,605 605,910 930,1220 1220,1385
To right before in the

474
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:13,335
0,150 150,300 300,575 715,990 990,1200
key of f right before

475
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,660
0,195 195,390 390,725
that f core.|

476

0,210 210,375 375,540 540,735 735,960
Not the two, five and

477
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,520
0,255 255,420 420,525 525,705 705,900
c, but the two five

478
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,255
0,165 165,270 270,450 450,570 570,735
of the chord that I'm

479
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,320
0,210 210,540 540,765 765,900 900,1065

0,150 150,315 315,480 480,675 675,885

0,305 505,765 765,915 915,1140 1140,1475

0,320 320,440 440,590 590,755 755,1025
Let's hear how that changes

0,240 240,435 435,600 600,735 735,1025
the sound a little bit.|

0,90 90,225 225,405 405,645 645,885
whole lot more color there,

0,210 210,425 535,795 795,900 900,1145
didn't it? In the next

five going into the f

491
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,630
0,195 195,255 255,345 345,525 525,750
and then I throw another

492
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,785
0,225 225,465 465,720 720,945 945,1155
two, five, going back into

493
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,060
0,255 255,605 715,1005 1005,1215 1215,1275
that c, if we're going

494
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,185
0,135 135,315 315,590 700,1020 1020,1125
to repeat it, let's hear

495
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:50,270
0,135 135,300 300,570 570,810 810,1085
how that changes the sound.|

496
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,215
0,400 750,1150 3660,3965 3965,4175 4175,4325
Ready? Go to five and

497
00:13:55,215 --> 00:14:00,030
0,245 3745,4065 4065,4290 4290,4545 4545,4815
f, then two, five and

499
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,810
0,320 320,545 545,770 770,995 995,1160
Now, sunday have created a

500
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,250
0,180 180,495 495,765 765,990 990,1440
much more interesting chord progression

501
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,440
0,120 120,300 300,585 585,855 855,1190
by just adding two fives.

502
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,220
0,320 320,545 545,770 770,965 965,1100
{Another,good -} simple rule that

503
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,405
0,120 120,240 240,500 670,990 990,1185
you can use is whenever

504
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:13,580
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,870 870,1175
you have a dominant seventh,

505
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,325
0,260 260,365 365,455 455,560 560,725
this would be like a

506
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:15,920
0,305 325,720 720,960 960,1230 1230,1595

C seventh and f seventh,

508
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,480
0,270 270,480 480,770
something like that.|

509
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,085
0,240 240,530 670,1035 1035,1320 1320,1605
You can always play around

510
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:22,480
0,240 240,495 495,870 870,1155 1155,1395
with that seventh and add

511
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,950
0,285 285,540 540,780 780,1095 1095,1470
a bunch of stuff on

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,630
0,210 210,450 450,630 630,720 720,810
flat nine, you can add

0,135 135,345 345,585 585,750 750,855
a sharp nine, you can

517
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:30,460
0,135 135,360 360,600 600,780 780,975

0,365 365,485 485,575 575,680 680,800
Let's take a look at

521
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,615
0,260 700,1100 1180,1530 1530,1875 1875,2175

0,305 835,1235 1675,1950 1950,2070 2070,2205
your sheet starts with A

523
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,580
0,195 195,465 465,830 2440,2670 2670,2760

526
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,175
0,105 105,315 315,1040 1150,1410 1410,1515
our base progression now the

00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,200
0,180 180,515
next one.|

528

0,210 210,345 345,510 510,675 675,930
I have A C minor

529
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,840
0,380 850,1125 1125,1290 1290,1515 1515,1710
seven and then I throw

top of that is eleventh

589
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,075
0,320 320,910 1440,2110 2460,2690 2690,2765
and thirteenth, thirteenth. {Okay,,well, -}

590
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,200
0,180 180,345 345,540 540,795 795,1125
let's talk about some confusion

591
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,015
0,255 255,560 1000,1335 1335,1500 1500,1815
right there. Don't get lost

592
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:33,620
0,255 255,405 405,555 555,815
in all the numbers.|

593
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,885
0,390 390,650 1120,1575 1575,1950 1950,2265
There's not. There's ninth, elevenvents

594
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:36,800
0,105 105,450 450,615 615,735 735,915
and thirteenth is what we're

595
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,970
0,150 150,375 375,680 730,1065 1065,1170
talking about. {Basically,,there's -} the

596
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,530
0,260 310,710 1060,1320 1320,1440 1440,1560
major {scale.,And -} then, if

597
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,625
0,105 105,225 225,480 480,780 780,1095
you can imagine another major

598
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,705
0,315 315,585 585,840 840,975 975,1080
scale right next to it,

599
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:42,770
0,150 150,345 345,540 540,915 915,1065
just like two octaves of

600
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,820
0,150 150,440
a scale.|

601
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,665
0,380 580,840 840,975 975,1500 1500,1845
Okay, so the ninth would

602
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:47,260
0,240 240,375 375,540 540,845 1195,1595
actually be the second scale

603
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,320
0,400 480,710 710,785 785,905 905,1040
degree. {So,if -} I was

604
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,295
0,180 180,435 435,615 615,840 840,975
in c, the ninth would

605
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:50,600
0,135 135,285 285,575
be a D.|

606
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,740
0,260 260,395 395,545 545,800 800,1070
See how that works. {The,eleventh

607
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,285
0,300 300,495 495,735 735,1010 1150,1545
-} is actually the fourth

608
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:54,215
0,360 360,600 600,735 735,840 840,930
scale degree, which would be

609
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:55,360
0,105 105,365
an f.|

610
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,375
0,400 900,1610 1610,1955 1955,2240 2240,2525
The thirteenth in c would

611
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,695
0,255 255,405 405,555 555,845 1045,1320
actually be an a same

612
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:00,715
0,150 150,315 315,605 655,900 900,1020
as the sixth. {Well,then -}

613
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,395
0,180 180,450 450,735 735,1235 1315,1680
why bother saying ninth, eleventh

614
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,430
0,120 120,495 495,645 645,795 795,1035
and thirteenth at all? Won't

615
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,870
0,90 90,240 240,530 760,1140 1140,1440
you just say second and

616
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,970
0,285 285,630 630,1010 1330,1730 1840,2100
fourth and sixth? Well, when

617
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,380
0,180 180,435 435,885 885,1260 1260,1410
I say ninth, eleventh and

618
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,960
0,495 495,735 735,930 930,1215 1215,1580
thirteenth, I am telling you.|

619
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,580
0,395 395,725 725,1060 1350,1625 1625,1940
Secret by code that there's

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,440
0,180 180,500 610,915 915,1220

0,400 510,755 755,920 920,1145 1145,1690
Okay, so A C ninth.|

622
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,540
0,225 225,375 375,600 600,950 1360,1760
Would be A C E

0,275 275,470 470,790 840,1175 1175,1415
And A D why, where

625
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:24,215
0,75 75,195 195,345 345,555 555,810
I get that b flat

626
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,355
0,225 225,480 480,645 645,855 855,1140

Everything. It's always a flated

0,320 520,810 810,990 990,1185 1185,1335

0,400 780,1040 1040,1175 1175,1310 1310,1570

0,300 300,600 600,690 690,885 885,1035

0,290 550,825 825,960 960,1065 1065,1170

0,225 225,495 495,845 1075,1425 1425,1775
C E G B, flat

688
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,340
0,380 380,650 650,875 875,1210
d and now f.|

689
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,210
0,400 930,1265 1265,1550 1550,1900 2370,2770
Now, in theory land, I

690
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,200
0,400 570,970
have that.|

691
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,105
0,380 700,990 990,1185 1185,1490 1600,1905
E and that f both

692
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:04,080
0,180 180,345 345,645 645,840 840,975
in that chord, but in

693
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,630
0,920 1180,1485 1485,1770 1770,2030 2110,2550
practicality, whenever there's that eleventh

694
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,620
0,135 135,300 300,480 480,780 780,990
in there, I don't include

695
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,640
0,165 165,440
the third.|

696
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
0,260 260,380 380,545 545,740 740,1520
So it would, in practicality,

697
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,465
0,105 105,330 330,570 570,825 825,1065
when I'm actually playing it,

698
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:12,980
0,180 180,450 450,645 645,965
I omit that third.|

699
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,475
0,350 350,515 515,590 590,785 785,1385
Okay, so it be cg

700
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:16,130
0,300 300,665 1015,1290 1290,1410 1410,1655
b flat, d and f.|

701
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,785
0,105 105,240 240,450 450,675 675,885
I just dropped that third

702
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,390
0,165 165,270 270,450 450,815 1285,1605
because it would clash with

703
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,680
0,320 1150,1760
the eleventh.|

704
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,910
0,210 210,315 315,420 420,680 940,1230
See how that works in

705
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,185
0,270 270,510 510,720 720,1140 1140,1275
f and f? Eleventh would

706
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:26,710
0,275 415,815 1465,1830 1830,2160 2160,2525
be F C E flat,

707
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,700
0,400 600,950 950,1300
G B flat.|

708
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,765
0,400 450,695 695,785 785,905 905,1055
Okay, what if I wanted

709
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:30,905
0,105 105,255 255,555 555,885 885,1140
an f minor eleven? Well,

710
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:31,655
0,150 150,240 240,375 375,570 570,750
then I can still throw

711
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:33,005
0,180 180,375 375,540 540,815 1105,1350
that third in there. {I,don't

712
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,935
0,135 135,255 255,450 450,675 675,930
-} have that half step

713
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:34,930
0,300 300,495 495,615 615,735 735,995
clash like I did {before.,So

714
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,245
0,215 215,320 320,515 515,770 770,1055
-} it becomes F A

715
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:38,080
0,300 300,665 835,1185 1185,1485 1485,1835
flat, C E flat G

716
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,500
0,350 350,700
B flat.|

717
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,735
0,400 510,785 785,1060 1470,1775 1775,1955
Okay, see how important it

718
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:42,830
0,225 225,435 435,570 570,765 765,1095
is to know your scales,

719

0,165 165,345 345,540 540,870 870,960
to spell these chords. {When,we

721
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:46,085
0,90 90,225 225,435 435,885 885,1080

section, this is gonna become

0,150 150,405 405,630 630,765 765,1050

one.|

0,260 260,380 380,545 545,830 830,1040
Because it would clash with
