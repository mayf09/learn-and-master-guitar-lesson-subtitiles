00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,960
0,270 270,540 540,630 630,960 960,1350
Okay, welcome to session three.|

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,350
0,60 60,210 210,270 270,420 420,600
We're going to cover two

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,860
0,150 150,480 480,1110
more musical concepts.|

5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,380
0,780 810,1080 1080,1560 1560,1890 1890,2010
Ties and dots before we're

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,010
0,180 180,240 240,450 450,570 570,630
ready to move on to

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,080
0,60 60,270 270,720
the next section.|

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,750
0,360 360,480 480,720 720,1140 1140,1560
Let's talk about ties first.|

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,790
0,120 120,600 600,750 750,1050 1050,1140
The problem we have is

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,810
0,120 120,270 270,330 330,570 570,1020
we need to have long

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,340
0,390 390,480 480,930 1050,1320 1320,1530
notes in music now whole

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,300
0,180 180,270 270,510 510,630 630,960
note will hold for four

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,200
0,240 240,360 360,540 540,750 750,900
beats we learned about that,

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,710
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,360 360,510
but what if I want

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,420
0,360 390,720 720,930 960,1320 1320,1710
to hold for six beats

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,550
0,480 480,840 840,1020 1170,1410 1410,1740
a or eight or something

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,660
0,390 390,480 480,720 720,930 930,1110
beyond a bar line, how

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,980
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,660 1020,1320
do we do that well

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,690
0,120 120,480 480,720 960,1500 1500,1710
we cover that problem with

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,160
0,30 390,630 630,870 870,900 900,1440
a thing called a tie

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,020
0,390 420,900 960,1410 1410,1560 1560,1740
that marked line that you

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,720
0,480
see.|

23
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,740
0,300 300,570 570,810 810,1410
Over those two nodes.|

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,880
0,330 330,450 450,870 870,1200 1200,1800
That is what's called tie

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,830
0,150 150,360 360,750 840,1380 1380,1620
and it is linking those

26
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,480
0,180 180,450 450,990 1260,1560 1560,1650
two notes together so as

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,650
0,150 150,420 420,540 540,870 870,1170
you're seeing in that first

28
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,140
0,660 900,1200 1200,1590 1590,2040 2310,2490
example, the whole note is

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,520
0,270 270,540 540,630 630,930 930,1380
tied over the bar line

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,940
0,150 150,270 270,630 630,930
to the half note.|

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,770
0,120 120,300 300,480 480,630 630,1170
And how this is played

32
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,080
0,630 660,1080 1080,1230 1230,1650 1890,2130
the half note gets two

33
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,370
0,420 450,600 600,780 780,1020 1020,1290
beats the whole note gets

34
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,340
0,270 270,720
four beats.|

35
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,070
0,420 420,600 600,900 900,1170 1170,1410
So I add all those

36
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,930
0,570 660,810 810,1050 1050,1560 1560,1860
together I don't replay that

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,920
0,360 360,540 540,690 690,750 750,960
half note when I get

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,910
0,180 180,360 450,630 630,840 840,990
to it I just give

39
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,050
0,210 210,420 420,870 930,1050 1050,1140
his two beats to the

40
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,190
0,240 240,540 720,870 870,1080 1080,1140
whole note to make a

41
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,920
0,390 390,540 540,960 960,1500
total of six beats.|

42
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,550
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,810 810,990
See how that works, I'm

43
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,720
0,210 210,540 540,750 750,930 930,1170
just tying those two notes

44
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,920
0,420 420,420 420,660 660,1020 1020,1200
together I don't replay that

45
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,150
0,300 300,540 630,840 840,1050 1050,1230
second note I just add

46
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,950
0,90 90,330 330,780 1230,1410 1410,1800
them both together in example

47
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,600
0,450 930,1110 1110,1260 1260,1320 1320,1650
two you'll see a quarter

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,380
0,390
note.|

49
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,070
0,360 360,690 810,960 960,1050 1050,1110
Half note and then a

50
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,300
0,270 270,450 450,660 660,1050 1050,1230
quarter note that's tied over

51
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,500
0,90 90,360 360,780
the bar line.|

52
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,650
0,180 180,240 240,420 420,480 480,570
To a note of the

53
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,720
0,360 360,870 1020,1560 1560,1680 1680,2070
same pitch ties are always

54
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,380
0,90 90,210 210,450 450,570 570,660
to the note of the

55
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,610
0,360 360,780 810,930 930,1110 1110,1230
same pitch you're never going

56
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,480
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,570 570,870
to see him going between

57
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,130
0,270 270,750 1080,1260 1260,1410 1410,1650
different pitches, they're going between

58
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,330
0,300 300,600 600,780 780,960 960,1200
different pitches, that's what's called

59
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,440
0,30 30,600 630,900 900,960 960,1110
a slur and we don't

60
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,310
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,660 660,870
really see those too much

61
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,320
0,60 60,360 360,720
in guitar music.|

62
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,570
0,480 840,1050 1050,1230 1230,1410 1410,1620
Um, so that I goes

63
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,560
0,210 210,270 270,570 570,870 870,990
over the bar line with

64
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,970
0,210 210,480 480,960 960,1110 1110,1410
those quarter notes, then another

65
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,350
0,270 270,660 1080,1230 1230,1320 1320,1380
quarter note and then a

66
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,580
0,330 330,660 900,1380 1380,1860
half note tied over.|

67
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,350
0,210 210,270 270,540 540,840 1380,1590
To a whole note, so

68
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,130
0,90 90,210 210,330 330,450 450,780
if I was to play

69
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,810
0,510 1200,1350 1350,1500 1500,1620 1620,1680
this, I'm just going to

70
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,130
0,210 210,330 330,570 600,990 990,1320
do on a first string

71
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,940
0,540
e.|

72
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,670
0,180 180,330 330,570 570,780 810,1290
And I'll play that example

73
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,440
0,450
too.|

74
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,370
0,780 1110,1680 2010,2820 3030,3780 4020,4500
Ready, go one one to

75
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,960
0,270 300,570 570,660 660,960 960,1320
tide over the bar line

76
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,940
0,960 1830,2580 2700,3240 3540,4230 4440,4980
here one two one two

77
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,430
0,600 840,1350 1620,1860 1860,1980 1980,2130
three four see how that

78
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,180
0,360
works.|

79
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,620
0,180 180,390 390,750 750,810 810,900
The next concept, we need

80
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,940
0,60 60,240 240,480 480,720 720,1320
to talk about is dots,

81
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,550
0,540 570,1200 1200,1620 1620,2070 2070,2160
now dots, add something to

82
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,650
0,120 120,420 690,1410 1410,1860 1860,2100
the note dot sad, here's

83
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,900
0,90 90,600 660,1320 1320,1830 1830,2250
the rule dots, add one

84
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,510
0,630 900,1110 1110,1800 1830,2100 2100,2610
half of whatever they're attached

85
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,120
0,270
to.|

86
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,220
0,180 180,240 240,270 270,450 450,600
What do I mean by

87
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,970
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,660 660,750
that well let's look at

88
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,440
0,120 120,600 810,1050 1050,1140 1140,1470
our example in our half

89
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
0,180 180,750 840,1080 1080,1260 1260,1320
note example I have a

90
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,620
0,390 390,750 1200,1440 1440,1530 1530,1860
half note with a dot

91
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,300
0,180 180,300
on it.|

92
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,360
0,150 150,510 510,960 960,1230 1230,1500
A half note gets two

93
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,240
0,540
beats.|

94
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,860
0,180 180,840
The dot.|

95
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,990
0,210 210,300 300,390 390,660 660,900
What is the dot get

96
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,460
0,90 90,360 360,570 570,1290 1320,1470
the dot gets half of

97
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,140
0,390 390,540 540,1020 1020,1320
whatever it's attached to.|

98
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,650
0,510 840,1170 1170,1320 1320,1530 1530,1890
So half note gets two

99
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,580
0,150 150,450 450,570 570,750 750,900
the dot would then get

100
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,510
0,420 450,630 630,720 720,810 810,930
one so you add them

101
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,710
0,150 150,240 240,720 870,1020 1020,1200
all up together and that

102
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,900
0,270 270,840
gets three.|

103
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,240
0,180 180,510 510,1140 1590,1800 1800,1860
Our next example is a

104
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,140
0,330 330,570 570,690 690,780 780,900
whole note, what if I

105
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,490
0,150 150,240 240,720 1110,1290 1290,1350
put a dot on a

106
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,810
0,300 300,540 660,990 990,1170 1170,1320
whole note usually about this

107
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,100
0,270 270,540 540,750 750,930 1080,1290
stage, everybody gets it I

108
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,300
0,210 210,420 450,600 600,960 960,1200
get it a dot adds

109
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,980
0,510 990,1350 1350,1500 1500,1530 1530,1680
one well it's a little

110
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,630
0,960 960,1110 1110,1230 1230,1350 1350,1650
more to it than that

111
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,190
0,480 480,720 750,1140 1140,1230 1230,1440
if it's attached to a

112
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,450
0,420 420,570 570,660 660,870 870,1230
half note, it adds one

113
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,470
0,180 180,300 300,660 660,750 750,840
if it's attached to a

114
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,000
0,300 300,660 930,1110 1110,1350 1350,1530
whole note, it adds more

115
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,750
0,90 90,270 270,420 420,660 660,750
than that, let's figure it

116
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,700
0,240 270,450 450,1020 1140,1560 1560,1950
out a dotted whole note

117
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,290
0,120 120,330 330,510 510,750 750,1260
the whole note gets four.|

118
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,280
0,180 180,540 540,690 690,750 750,870
The dot what is the

119
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,560
0,270 270,690 960,1680 1740,1920 1920,2280
dot kid half of whatever

120
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,090
0,150 150,600 600,900 1050,1440 1440,1530
it's attached to half of

121
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,580
0,480 510,720 720,1200
four is two.|

122
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,320
0,330 330,600 600,900 930,1080 1080,1500
Four plus two is six

123
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,700
0,210 210,210 210,660 660,1020 1020,1380
so a dotted whole note.|

124
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,690
0,150 150,270 270,330 330,450 450,1050
Is going to be six

125
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,590
0,210 210,360 360,420 420,600 600,840
you're going to see that

126
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,730
0,240 240,660 690,900 900,930 930,1140
very much, but I wanted

127
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,510
0,90 90,150 150,330 330,420 420,780
you to see the difference

128
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,620
0,210 210,300 300,450 450,630 780,1110
between the other one, here's

129
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,070
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,360 360,450
what you're going to see

130
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,360
0,30 30,180 180,300 300,690
a little bit more.|

131
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,060
0,180 180,750 750,1230 1230,1680 2070,2250
A dotted quarter note now

132
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,230
0,270 270,540 540,750 750,930 930,1170
think about what would this

133
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,700
0,300 390,780 780,1050 1050,1260 1260,1470
be the quarter note gets

134
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,170
0,450 480,660 660,750 750,1230 1290,1470
one and the dot what

135
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,320
0,120 120,210 210,510 510,810
would the dot get.|

136
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,690
0,150 150,420 420,540 540,780 780,990
The dog would just get

137
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,030
0,150 150,870 1320,1590 1590,1830 1890,2340
a half because it's half

138
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,960
0,60 60,360 360,480 480,870 870,930
of whatever it's attached to

139
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,920
0,90 90,240 240,630 630,720 720,960
and it's attached to just

140
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,780
0,330 870,1080 1080,1500 1500,1800 1800,1860
one so one plus a

141
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,040
0,450 480,690 690,1080 1080,1170 1170,1260
half b one and a

142
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,780
0,540
half.|

143
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,400
0,180 180,450 510,870 870,1110 1110,1260
And that would make up

144
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,050
0,60 60,720 720,1140 1140,1290 1290,1650
a complete beat, but usually

145
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,920
0,150 150,300 300,420 420,750 750,870
you'd see it followed by

146
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,300
0,420 420,600 600,870 990,1200 1200,1380
another eighth note and that's

147
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,260
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,630 630,960
how they make those rhythms

148
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,780
0,240
work.|

149
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,030
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,630 630,990
And that's ties and dots.|

150
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,930
0,390 390,570 570,720 720,990 990,1200
Okay, let's talk about eighth

151
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,060
0,390 660,1080 1080,1410 1410,1860 1950,2130
notes now eighth notes are

152
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,020
0,210 210,270 270,450 450,720 720,960
part of that group of

153
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,130
0,420 420,540 540,630 630,870 870,1110
rhythms that we talked about

154
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,390
0,60 60,180 180,390 390,900 930,1260
at the very beginning whole

155
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,670
0,240 240,450 450,810 810,1410 1920,2280
notes get four beats half

156
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,380
0,270 270,540 540,870 870,1440
notes, get two beats.|

157
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,020
0,330 330,600 600,780 780,1170 1170,1500
Quarter notes get one beat

158
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,710
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,540 540,600
and now we're going to

159
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,600
0,660 660,840 840,1170 1170,1440 1440,1890
subdivide that one beat we're

160
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,830
0,150 150,540 540,630 630,900 900,1230
gonna split the one beat.|

161
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,140
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,390 390,510
And we're going to go

162
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,370
0,120 120,480 480,900 900,1140 1140,1230
to eighth notes which will

163
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,270
0,300 300,450 450,510 510,810 810,870
each get a half a

164
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,520
0,390 960,1470 1500,1800 1800,1950 1950,2250
beat now as it's played

165
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,990
0,60 60,120 120,810 930,1350 1350,1470
on the guitar when you

166
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,160
0,180 180,630 630,690 690,780 780,1170
have several of the same

167
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,830
0,510 1020,1650 1650,1710 1710,2040 2040,2670
note on the same string.|

168
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,440
0,180 180,390 390,1050 1050,1170 1170,1560
You would alternate your picking

169
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,100
0,240 240,360 360,480 480,600 600,660
remember what we did in

170
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,720
0,180 180,420 420,870 960,1290 1290,1620
that first session, we did

171
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,940
0,180 180,510 510,930 960,1230 1230,1890
a finger pattern of down

172
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,300
0,480 660,1440 1590,1950
up down up.|

173
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,950
0,420 420,510 510,630 630,720 720,1200
That we're going to apply

174
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,880
0,240 240,450 450,570 570,690 690,930
that now and we're working

175
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,870
0,240 240,480 480,750 750,870 870,990
with eighth notes, if the

176
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,460
0,270 270,360 360,420 420,960 960,1590
notes are the same pitch

177
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,030
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,450 450,510
let's say you had a

178
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,870
0,240 240,420 420,660 660,750 750,840
bunch of e's in a

179
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,490
0,420 780,1050 1050,1350 1350,1410 1410,1620
row then instead of just

180
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,660
0,240 240,510 510,720 720,960 960,1170
going down down down down

181
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,000
0,210 210,450 450,960
down down down.|

182
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,660
0,210 210,450 450,900
You just go.|

183
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,560
0,1050 1110,1710 2010,3330 3360,3900 4380,4590
Down up down up, so

184
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,510
0,90 90,390 390,810 870,1410 1410,1950
I wouldn't go down down

185
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,610
0,540 540,1590 1620,1830 1830,1980 1980,2100
down, down I would go

186
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,140
0,810 870,1260 1800,2910 2970,3330
down up down up.|

187
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,710
0,420 450,660 660,780 780,930 930,1200
Now one more thing about

188
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,150
0,180 180,480 630,1020 1020,1260 1260,1440
eighth notes when eighth notes

189
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,530
0,60 60,240 240,1050 1080,1230 1230,1380
are by themselves, they have

190
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,730
0,90 90,690 690,870 870,930 930,1200
a flag on the stem,

191
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,600
0,90 90,180 180,270 270,510 510,870
you have the note head,

192
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,380
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,660 660,780
you have a stem they

193
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,280
0,120 120,150 150,300 300,720 720,900
have a little flag on

194
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,740
0,90
it.|

195
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,410
0,210 210,450 480,1260 1410,1650 1650,2100
When they're together they're grouped

196
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,640
0,390 390,510 510,660 660,840 840,1080
when or when there's more

197
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,900
0,120 120,570 600,720 720,930 930,1260
than one where there's two

198
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,310
0,300 300,510 510,600 600,990 1080,1410
a group of more they're

199
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,470
0,330 330,900 930,1140 1140,1650 1650,2160
grouped together in twos usually

200
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,330
0,300 300,450 450,750 750,990 990,1440
and they use a beam

201
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,380
0,420 420,510 510,810 810,900 900,1050
across the top of them

202
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,250
0,180 180,390 390,510 510,630 630,840
so that's what you'll see

203
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,210
0,150 150,360 360,660 660,840 840,960
when that beam is you

204
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,170
0,120 120,240 240,660 660,810 810,960
may be confused about what

205
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,220
0,150 150,330 330,600
that might be.|

206
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,530
0,420 420,450 450,630 660,930 930,1260
Those are just eighth notes

207
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,030
0,360 360,690 690,990 990,1320 1320,1440
tied together, somebody figured out

208
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,050
0,30 30,330 330,600 600,780 780,1020
a hundred fifty years ago

209
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,860
0,240 360,600 600,660 660,750 750,810
that when you have a

210
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,640
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,720 720,780
bunch of eighth notes in

211
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,150
0,60 60,180 180,300 300,450 450,510
a row, it's kind of

212
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,990
0,330 330,420 420,630 630,750 750,840
difficult to read when they

213
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,220
0,180 180,300 300,480 480,960 1050,1230
have all those flags so

214
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,120
0,60 60,300 300,450 450,570 570,900
they just beam them together

215
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,630
0,150 150,210 210,240 240,390 390,510
makes it a little bit

216
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,100
0,300 300,390 390,690 1080,1290 1290,1470
easier to read, so let's

217
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,820
0,120 120,300 300,510 510,570 570,720
go through some of the

218
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,740
0,240 240,450 450,1320 1530,1800 1800,1920
eighth known exercises in your

219
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,270
0,390 570,810 810,990 990,1170 1290,1530
book, let's look at a

220
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,430
0,180 180,810 810,1080 1080,1440 1860,2160
zen exercise number one that's

221
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,930
0,150 150,270 270,720 750,1140 1140,1500
on your first east ring.|

222
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,890
0,270 270,510 510,810 810,1140 1140,1440
We talked about down up

223
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,300
0,360 360,750 990,1170 1170,1260 1260,1410
down up when we get

224
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,620
0,60 60,210 210,450 450,870 1080,1320
to the eighth notes let's

225
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,200
0,300 630,2190 2280,3930 3960,4860 4890,5580
play down down down up

226
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,380
0,990 1020,1770 1800,3540 3570,5160 5190,6150
down up down down down

227
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,290
0,630 720,1650 1740,2250 2250,2340 2340,2880
up down up now next

228
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,970
0,330 330,870 1590,2580 2640,3060 3510,4680
known f down up down

229
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,930
0,540 540,780 780,930 930,1770 1860,3360
down back to ie down

230
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,340
0,990 1020,1620 1770,3570 3600,4110
down up down, too.|

231
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,150
0,270 270,450 540,810 810,930 930,1140
Got it, see how those

232
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,590
0,300 300,390 390,630 630,960 1170,1440
downs and UPS work now

233
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,000
0,210 210,450 450,630 630,1170 1170,1410
that really only applies when

234
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,720
0,150 150,270 270,330 330,600 600,720
it's of the note of

235
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,620
0,90 90,450 450,720 720,840 840,900
the same pitch when you

236
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,160
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,480 480,540
have a bunch of the

237
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,270
0,300 300,570 570,660 660,750 750,1110
same note in a row

238
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,650
0,270 270,480 480,720 720,960 960,1140
now you'll find out really

239
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,430
0,330 330,420 420,510 510,660 660,780
quickly as we go through

240
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,140
0,180 180,960 990,1260 1260,1380 1380,1710
these exercises as you're jumping

241
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,100
0,360 360,450 450,660 660,750 750,960
strings and stuff you really

242
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,810
0,210 210,630 810,1290 1290,1410 1410,1710
can't hold true to that

243
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,760
0,270 270,360 360,720 780,1440 1440,1950
down and up alternating pattern

244
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,690
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,600 600,750
all the time, it just

245
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,890
0,270 270,540 600,840 840,1020 1020,1200
doesn't work out that way

246
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,910
0,150 150,450 450,540 540,810 810,1020
your brain will figure that

247
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,830
0,210 360,720 720,1140 1290,1680 1680,1920
out pretty quickly but only

248
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,520
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,600 600,690
when you have notes of

249
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,630
0,90 90,390 390,840 870,1050 1050,1110
the same pitch on the

250
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,010
0,300 300,660 690,870 870,960 960,1380
same line that you start

251
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,910
0,210 210,660 660,780 780,870 870,900
doing alternating you'll be a

252
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,810
0,150 150,270 270,660 660,840 840,900
little bit faster doing it

253
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,400
0,210 210,390
that way.|

254
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,570
0,210 210,330 330,330 330,630 630,960
Let's do a couple more

255
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,340
0,600 600,810 810,1260
exercise number two.|

0,300 300,420 420,750 750,990 1230,1740
This one starts on second

257
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,340
0,510 570,1020 1020,1530 1680,2370
string first finger c.|

0,150 150,240 240,1020 2460,3270 3270,3600
up to g down these

261
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,980
0,660 1590,2310 2310,2460 2460,2820 2820,3000
notes alternating your picking with

262
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,420
0,240 240,870 1920,2760 3240,4290
each one and rest.|

263
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,140
0,1320 1890,2280 2430,2790 2790,2850 2850,2940
Okay, we're going to do

264
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,120
0,630 630,900 900,1260 1620,1920 1920,1980
exercise for now okay I'm

265
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,600

going to do a little

266
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,280
0,120 120,690 1020,1290 1290,1440 1440,1680
bit faster so you try

267
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,390
0,300 300,690 690,780 780,1020 1020,1110
and do the best you

268
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,020
0,360
can.|

269
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:43,240
0,600 630,1050 1230,3000 7260,10290 10290,10290
Ready go, {go's -} are

that third string is that's

278
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,030
0,150 150,780 1200,1770 1770,1950 1950,2310
your g kg is open,

279
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,660
0,90 90,270 270,390 390,480 480,630
and that will be our

280
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,330

0,330 330,690 690,1440 1860,2070 2070,2160
your music notation is A

283
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,480
0,600 930,1170 1170,1440 1440,1890 1890,2160

0,150 150,480 480,540 540,750 750,990
you're fretting the note nice

290
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,900
0,90 90,360 360,450 450,810
and close to that.|

291
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,630
0,480 480,720 720,840 840,900 900,1320
Fret not on the fret

right back so we have

293
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,250
0,1590 1590,1770 1770,1920 1920,2160 2160,3270
g and we have a

294
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,850

now a very good let's

296
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,600
0,150 150,330 330,450 450,570 570,720
add those to our other

297
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,330
0,480 630,810 810,1170 1170,2310 2580,2730
notes, we've got g and

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,150
0,120 120,300 300,420 420,840 840,1410
you've got your bracing happening.|

404
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,700
0,720 1020,1230 1230,1350 1350,1590 1590,1770
Solid and if you and

405
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,840
0,180 180,300 300,450 450,870 870,1140
that you go slow enough,

406
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,980
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,1020 1020,1140
some of these exercises I

407
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,000
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,870 870,1020
may be going faster than

408
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,040
0,300 300,570 750,1110 1110,1500 1620,2040
you're at right now, just

409
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,170
0,390 390,690 690,750 750,1170 1170,1770
just stop the tape practice

410
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,980
0,90 90,150 150,360 360,630 630,810
it a little bit on

411
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,740
0,150 150,480
your own.|

412
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,290
0,210 210,390 390,720 720,960 960,1170
And then you'll be ready

413
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,160
0,90 90,300 300,510 510,630 630,870
to go when it's time

414
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,180
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,540 540,1020
for us to play together.|

415
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,730
0,180 180,510 510,780 780,870 870,1230
Hey, welcome to the guitar

416
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,410
0,330 330,750 750,870 870,1320 1320,1680
tips section of session three

417
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,310
0,240 240,420 420,480 480,630 630,810
we're going to talk about

418
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,150
0,180 180,300 300,570 570,690 690,840
what I what I think

419
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,660
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,330 330,510
is one of the most

420
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,370
0,540 540,870 870,960 960,1410 1410,1710
practical things and helpful things

421
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,930
0,150 150,270 270,600 660,930 930,1560
you can do to improve

422
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,520
0,450 450,570 570,630 630,1110 1440,1590
yourself as a player he

423
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,900
0,120 120,450 450,600 600,660 660,1380
is working with a metronome

424
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,400
0,870
metronome.|

425
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,950
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,720 720,930
Is a little thing like

426
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,390
0,360 420,810 810,990 990,1260 1260,1440
this, they have also ones

427
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,620
0,270 420,600 600,660 660,930 930,1230
that are the tick tock

428
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,550
0,300 300,420 420,570 570,810 810,930
kind that go back and

429
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,750
0,420 510,750 750,1020 1020,1140 1140,1200
forth, they both do the

430
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,790
0,360 360,690 720,870 870,1140 1470,2040
same thing, it just clicks

431
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,100
0,360 360,480 480,1050
off the tempo.|

432
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,830
0,540 540,900 900,1260 1260,1440 1440,1500
Okay and working with a

433
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,410
0,630 840,1410 1410,1740 1740,2430 2430,2580
metronome is although frustrating at

434
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,360
0,600
first.|

435
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,180
0,270 270,870 870,1170 1170,1410 1410,1560
Is very very good for

436
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,380
0,330 330,480 480,810 810,1080 1080,1200
helping you settle down your

437
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,480
0,510 870,1320 1320,1560 1560,1740 1740,2100
time settle down your rhythm

438
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,400
0,210 210,360 360,660 660,1560 1710,1920
in these different exercises, so

439
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,060
0,120 120,180 180,360 360,540 540,660
let me just show you

440
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,200
0,120 120,330 330,750
how this works.|

441
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,230
0,240 240,360 360,420 420,660 660,750
I'm going to turn it

442
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,060
0,450
on.|

443
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,540
0,180 180,390 390,570 570,1050 1050,1500
And this is clicking off.|

444
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,370
0,450 450,570 570,750 750,840 840,1020
Let's see what does that

445
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,520
0,270 270,1350 1350,1980 2310,2730 2730,3150
say 72 beats per minute.|

446
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,960
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,570 570,840
And so I was playing

447
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,770
0,300 300,450 450,540 540,690 690,810
along with it let's say

448
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,970
0,150 150,420 420,480 480,750 750,1200
I'm playing A C chord.|

449
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,090
0,750 750,1590 1650,2340 3510,3930 3960,4170
Two three four I want

450
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:42,830
0,90 90,420 420,930 6630,7050 7050,7740
to half notes quarter notes

451
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,860
0,4920 5160,5400 5400,5520 5520,5700 5700,6030
good, so how that works,

452
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,330
0,360 390,720 720,1170 1170,1320 1320,1380
it really forces you to

453
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,490
0,180 180,810 1050,1590 1590,2070 2070,2160
be honest, um, sometimes if

454
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,350
0,120 120,510 510,690 690,1380 1710,1860
you're sitting and practicing you

455
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,130
0,180 180,420 420,660 660,720 720,780
know just sitting on the

456
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,780
0,360 360,1050 1200,1410 1410,1590 1590,1650
couch practicing you'll kind of

457
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,400
0,150 150,480 480,600 600,1230 1470,1620
let yourself get sloppy and

458
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,900
0,90 90,270 270,360 360,480 480,1500
you want to be real

459
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,100
0,570 600,2580 2610,2940 3630,3990 3990,4200
steady and you'll be doing

460
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,530
0,720 750,1170 1170,1710 1740,1980 1980,2430
a completely unsteady a metronome

461
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,280
0,150 150,330 330,420 420,510 510,750
will let you do that,

462
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,480
0,240 240,540 540,960 960,1140 1140,1200
it'll allow it kind of

463
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,260
0,360 360,480 480,540 540,660 660,780
forces you to be in

464
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,910
0,480 750,1080 1080,1350 1350,1470 1470,1650
tempo and when it's time

465
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,760
0,60 60,330 330,630
to speed up.|

466
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,740
0,180 180,450 450,540 540,690 690,720
I raise it up a

467
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,780
0,180 180,540
little bit.|

468
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,040
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,660 660,750
Let's raise it up to

469
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,900
0,180 180,330 330,1230
let's say 92.|

470
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,530
0,90 90,330 330,390 390,450 450,510
I'm going to do the

471
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,660
0,330 330,600 600,870 870,1380 1620,2130
same thing c chord ready,

472
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,990
0,450 720,1320 1320,1950 1950,2580 2610,3180
go one two three four

473
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,590
0,420 420,990 1620,2160 2160,2670 2700,6510
half notes quarter notes I

474
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:42,240
0,630 630,930 930,1260 1260,1950 7140,7620
can switch between chords can

475
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,600
0,120 120,510 510,900 3510,6360 6360,6360
do single {notes's -} are

476
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,990
0,330 330,480 480,510 510,960 960,1200
working with a metronome probably

477
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,590
0,90 90,150 150,210 210,420 420,600
one of the best things

478
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,340
0,120 120,210 210,450
you can do.|

479
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,580
0,360 360,450 450,480 480,600 600,660
Next thing I want to

480
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,450
0,120 120,390 390,480 480,570 570,870
talk about in our guitar

481
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,460
0,360 360,660 780,1440 1440,1620 1620,2010
tips is holding your notes

482
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,180
0,300 300,390 390,480 480,570 570,720
out if you have a

483
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,890
0,270 270,450 450,810 810,1170 1320,1710
really really long note let's

484
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,060
0,240 240,480 510,930 930,1110 1110,1170
say A G here on

485
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,770
0,90 90,360 360,780 1530,1650 1650,1710
the first string and I

486
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,790
0,180 180,240 240,510 510,690 690,1020
need to hold that out

487
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,870
0,180 180,300 300,660 660,870 870,1020
if I've got I 'm

488
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,040
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,750 750,1170
holding into the next measure,

489
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,330
0,330 330,510 510,690 690,1020 1020,1200
I've got a really the

490
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,970
0,480 480,1140 1140,1830 1830,2040 2160,2640
guitar, naturally {decay's -} it's

491
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,840
0,240 240,300 300,390 390,720 720,870
one of the instruments that

492
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,430
0,240 240,450 450,1050 1050,1320 1320,1590
doesn't really hold its yeah

493
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,480
0,240 240,480 480,540 540,960 960,1050
keep having to refresh the

494
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,180
0,300 900,1410 1920,2430 2430,2550 2550,2700
node so being that it

495
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,780
0,450
has.|

496
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,810
0,210 210,480 480,750 750,1170 1170,1680
A very quick decay time

497
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,310
0,360 360,540 540,780 780,1020 1020,1230
when you play that gee

498
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,360
0,240 240,510 510,690 690,870 870,1050
you really gotta keep that

499
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,170
0,300 300,420 420,510 510,690 690,810
finger on to get the

500
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,520
0,540 540,690 690,780 780,1140 1140,1350
most that you can out

501
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,590
0,60 60,330 840,1470 1560,1920 1920,2070

0,480 480,600 600,720 720,930 930,1170
Sometimes we get into the

524
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,230
0,420 420,540 540,720 720,930 930,1020
habit of just looking at

525
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,430
0,60 60,540 600,750 750,840 840,1200
the tops of the lines

526
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,090
0,90 90,270 270,360 360,420 420,660

0,60 60,150 150,630 810,990 990,1230
at the music, if that

533
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,190
0,210 210,330 330,570 570,660 660,1350
node is in the staff.|

534
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,090
0,540 540,1620 1620,1890 1890,1980 1980,2370
Second line that's the lower

535
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,260
0,420 630,780 780,930 930,1050 1050,1170
gi if it's up on

536
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,250
0,270 270,330 330,390 390,870 870,990
top of the staff on

537
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,780
0,90 90,360 360,930 1200,1320 1320,1530
the top space then that's

538
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,680
0,150 150,600 600,690 690,750 750,900
the apogee so you gotta

539
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,310

looking at the music, now

541
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,950
0,120 120,360 360,510 510,840 900,1500
we're getting into these doubles

542
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,940
0,90 90,420 420,690 690,810 810,990
of notes by the end

543
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,720
0,120 120,300 300,480 480,600 600,780
you'll have two and three

544
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,950

0,330 360,1230 1410,1620 1620,1770 1770,1950
called octaves so you'll have

546
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,920
0,210 210,510 510,840 840,960 960,1020
many different octaves by the

547
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,840
0,240 240,330 330,570
time we're done.|

548
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,480
0,570 810,1230 1230,1560 1560,1680 1680,2190
Okay, now, here's your assignment

549
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,160
0,120 120,300 300,720 930,1500 1500,1680
for this coming for this

550
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,720

the first through the fourth

554
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,880
0,300 300,1170 1170,1350 1350,1500 1500,1860
string exercises in your book.|

555
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,610
0,330 330,480 480,600 600,1290 1590,1770
Play through our songs that

556
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,690
0,90 90,270 270,600 600,780 780,1080
I have listed out their

557
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,080
0,420 420,930
yankee doodle.|

558
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,570
0,270 270,330 330,690 690,840 840,1260
When the saints go marching

559
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,300
0,330
in.|

560
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,080
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,1050
And love me tender.|

561
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,370
0,210 210,360 360,570 570,690 690,840
Now, we'll work on those

562
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,450
0,60 60,120 120,510 510,870 900,1080
in the workshop time so

563

0,90 90,240 240,300 300,600
I'll see you there.|

564
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,360
0,420 420,720 720,780 780,840 840,1350
Okay, welcome to the workshop

565
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,070
0,450 810,1110 1110,1380 1380,1470 1470,1710
time, um, this is where

566
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,810
0,210 210,660 690,900 900,1410 1410,1740
I think the work gets

567
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,740
0,390 420,540 540,660 660,720 720,930
done a lot of guys

568
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,910
0,270 270,540 540,750 750,810 810,1170
dream about being a guitar

569
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,650
0,270 270,420 420,1080 1290,1590 1590,1740
player, but here when you're

570
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,790
0,270 270,420 420,510 510,1050 1050,1140
actually doing the practicing is

571
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,580
0,180 180,870 1230,2310 2340,2550 2550,2790
what separates dreamers from guys

572
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,200
0,120 120,390 390,780 780,1140 1140,1620
that actually become guitar players,

573
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,950
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,600 600,720
so let's start going through

574
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,810
0,180 180,960 1170,1620 1620,1740 1740,1860
these exercises remember what we

575
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,400
0,270 270,510 510,780 780,1080 1440,1590
talked about last time we

576
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,260
0,180 180,1020 1080,1260 1260,1410 1410,1860
have ties we have dots

577
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,970
0,660 750,1080 1080,1320 1320,1410 1410,1710
ties tie over the bar

578
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,930
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,780 780,960
line and you add those

579
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,210
0,150 150,420 420,960 1260,2040 2070,2280
two notes together dots what

580
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,670
0,480 480,900 900,1290 1380,1980 1980,2460
do dots do dots, add

581
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,990
0,330 330,420 420,720 720,840 840,1320
half of whatever they're attached

582
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,380
0,240
to.|

583
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,340
0,390 390,480 480,600 600,660 660,780
Mainly you're going to see

584
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,450
0,90 90,450 450,540 540,840 840,1110
him attached to half notes

585
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:35,870
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,360 360,420
so it would be a

586
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,640
0,450 900,1350 1350,1410 1410,1500 1500,1770
dot attached to a half

587
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,840
0,210 210,330 330,630 630,780 780,1200
note would actually get three

588
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,640
0,540 870,1230 1260,1470 1470,1650 1650,1800
beats OK let's start going

589
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,840
0,120 120,300 300,390 390,540 540,1200
through some of these exercises

590
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,470
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,600 600,630
I'm gonna work with a

591
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,150
0,690 840,1020 1020,1110 1110,1380 1380,1680
metronome like we talked about

592
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,160
0,90 90,210 210,570 570,1080 1350,2010
in our guitar tips section

593
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,030
0,270 270,360 360,480 480,570 570,810
just so you can see

594
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,350
0,240 240,510 510,690 690,720 720,1320
how working with a metronome

595
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,450
0,330 330,660 660,900 900,1050 1050,1680
really pays off my metronome

596
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,130
0,180 180,420 420,510 510,750 750,1140
is set to about {66

597
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,660
0,600 630,960 960,1080 1080,1350 1350,1530
-} beats per minute right

598
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,340
0,360 1020,1200 1200,1350 1350,1500 1500,1680
now and let's go through

599
