0,60 60,480 720,1230 1230,1560 1560,2160
to cover using guitar effects

0,30 30,180 180,240 240,450 450,570
a lot to cover so

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,220
0,150 150,450 450,840
let's get started.|

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,220
0,540 1680,1950 1950,2130 2130,2370 2370,2460
Um, okay, the first thing

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,970
0,60 60,210 210,270 270,510 510,750
I wanted to talk about

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,690
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,480 480,720
is a couple of different

28
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,740
0,330 330,390 390,900 900,1020 1020,1050
types of guitars that are

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,080
0,420 420,780 1350,1500 1500,1980 1980,2340
mainly used in electric work,

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,060
0,240 240,480 480,690 690,1080 1080,1620
OK, there's three basic styles,

31
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,560
0,540 540,1230 1230,1320 1320,1410 1410,1500
little variations in them, but

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,700
0,180 180,240 240,300 300,690 690,1140
here are the basic styles,

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,440
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,930 1290,1740
this is a strata, regular

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,800
0,210 210,540 540,1500 1800,2580 2700,3360
old fender stratocaster different, um.|

35
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,590
0,480 480,900 990,1530 1530,1860 1890,2340
Guitar makers make them fenders

36
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,610
0,60 60,210 210,330 330,810 810,1020
the one that started it

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,160
0,360 360,720 810,1260 1260,1650 1650,2280
and its unique body design,

38
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,510
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,840 840,1200
and they use single coil

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,480
0,660
pickups.|

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,580
0,540 540,690 690,870 870,990 990,1380
It's real good for pop

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,330
0,330 330,480 480,510 510,660 660,750
things get a little bit

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,350
0,60 60,120 120,540 540,900 900,1020
of a sweeter sound with

43
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,370
0,30 30,390 390,690 690,960 960,1020
a single coil sound a

44
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,360
0,240 240,330 330,390 390,480 480,960
little bit of a smaller

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,400
0,450 510,780 780,1320 1380,1950 1950,2040
sound, but very articulate and

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,010
0,630 870,1260 1260,1320 1320,1830 2340,2610
dynamic that's a strategy OK

47
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,850
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,480 480,840
now we've got a tele

48
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,980
0,540 930,1230 1230,1290 1290,1560 1560,2130
caster, this is tele caster.|

49
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,520
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,660 660,900
Is a little bit, notice

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,330
0,90 90,390 390,660 660,750 750,810
the body shape is a

51
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,530
0,150 150,330 330,780 780,990 990,1200
little bit different still has

52
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,370
0,90 90,300 300,570 570,750 750,840
the cut away here at

53
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,020
0,90 90,630 990,1290 1290,1350 1350,1650
the bottom, but the body

54
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,800
0,240 240,360 360,420 420,570 570,780
shape is a little bit

55
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,240
0,450 720,870 870,1200 1200,1260 1260,1440
different they're generally a little

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,530
0,150 150,600 600,720 720,780 780,1290
bit heavier than a strategy

57
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,550
0,60 60,390 390,630 630,690 690,1020
as well, although it depends

58
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,510
0,90 90,270 270,450 450,570 570,960
on what type of wood

59
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,060
0,240 240,600 900,1380 1560,2280 2280,2430
is used, the weight of

60
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,320
0,120 480,600 600,780 780,870 870,1260
it, the thing that affects

61
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,000
0,330 330,450 450,870 870,1110 1110,1230
what your sound is going

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,080
0,60 60,150 150,480 480,600 600,1080
to be mainly your pickups

63
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,680
0,60 60,210 210,360 360,420 420,600
a little bit of what

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,090
0,120 120,480 480,660 660,960 960,1410
your strings are everything else

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,140
0,270 270,480 480,540 540,840 840,1020
what type of wood, this

66
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,580
0,150 150,450 450,660 660,930 990,1440
is made out of whether

67
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,720
0,120 120,360 360,690 690,750 750,1140
you have gold or Silver

68

0,390 390,450 450,510 510,930 990,1260
tuners at the top really

69
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,330
0,270 270,450 450,960 1020,1200 1200,1350
doesn't mean anything with how

70
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:21,960
0,120 120,390 390,450 450,570 570,630
your guitar is going to

71
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
0,360 660,960 960,1080 1080,1140 1140,1200
sound anyway, this is a

72
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,050
0,180 180,450 450,990 1110,1500 1500,1890

0,90 90,660 660,1140 1170,1590 1590,2280
are used, um almost exclusively

74

a little bit on the

80
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,880
0,420 420,690 690,780 780,1080 1080,1260
harsher side of things can

81
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,470
0,270 270,450 450,930 1110,1290 1290,1590
get real warm and fuzzy

82

0,180 180,420 510,870 870,1080 1080,1140
with them, but these are

83
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,390
0,210 210,390 390,480 480,630 630,780

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,710
0,1080 1080,1170 1170,1230 1230,1440 1440,1530
Amplification, let me turn my

101
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,460
0,360 360,570 570,990 3330,3540 3540,3750
volume off here you can't

102
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,200
0,240 240,540 540,1020 1470,1620 1620,1740
hear very well, but there

103
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,860
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,510 510,660
is a little bit of

104
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,900
0,360 360,660 1050,1500 1530,1710 1710,2040
sound there now it uses

105
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,610
0,240 240,810 810,1320 1320,1530 1530,1710
these big pickups here, these

106
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,750
0,180 180,390 390,690 690,1080 1080,1140
big hum bucking pickups were

107
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,410
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,420 420,660
going to learn what those

108
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,250
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,480 480,840
are here in a second.|

109
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,010
0,210 210,420 420,510 510,750 750,960
But it's a real good

110
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:32,640
0,2220 2250,6060 6510,6540 6540,10710
jazzy, Xiao Yu a.|

111
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,140
0,420 810,1200 1200,1290 1290,1590 1590,2100
You use a lot for

112
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,490
0,420 420,780 780,960 960,1050 1050,1350
Blues playing B B king

113
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,890
0,360 360,780 1200,1770 1860,2130 2130,2400
uses this, um as well,

114
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,970
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,930 930,1080
really good for jazz as

115
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,900
0,330 420,600 600,690 690,900 900,930
well, you can do a

116
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,370
0,450 450,540 540,720 720,1140 1140,1320
lot of good styles with

117
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,390
0,120 180,450 450,750 750,930 930,1020
it that's mainly used for

118
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,040
0,510 510,780 780,1080 1080,1380 1470,1650
jazz and Blues stuff, okay,

119
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,940
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,720 720,900
let's talk about different kinds

120
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,140
0,60 60,570 630,810 810,1020 1020,1200
of pickups I chose this

121
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,280
0,330 330,570 570,750 750,990 990,1140
guitar because this guitar just

122
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,750
0,180 180,240 240,330 330,900 900,1470
happen to have a mishmash

123
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,530
0,90 90,270 270,540 540,720 720,780
of all different kinds of

124
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,490
0,390 390,480 480,660 660,750 750,960
pickups I thought we could

125
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,140
0,450 450,510 510,660 660,1110 1110,1200
get a good example of

126
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,490
0,240 270,870 870,990 990,1140 1140,1350
them first let's talk about

127
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,050
0,180 180,630 630,1080 1140,1410 1410,1560
how pickups work what our

128
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,540
0,570 600,1080
pickups well.|

129
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,200
0,540 540,1110 1110,1230 1230,1740 1740,1920
Various styles and shapes on

130
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,670
0,480 480,570 570,1110 1110,1230 1230,1470
guitars but here's the three

131
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,480
0,330 330,450 450,540 540,720 720,810
pickups that I have on

132
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,220
0,150 150,420 420,960 1290,1620 1620,1740
this tele caster, now I'm

133
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,060
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,660 660,840
going to talk about this

134
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,900
0,210 210,510 510,660 660,810 810,840
one first, because it's a

135
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,010
0,150 150,270 270,660 660,750 750,1110
little bit easier to see

136
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,780
0,480 480,630 630,1050 1050,1320 1320,1560
all the pickup is a

137
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,130
0,480 840,960 960,1110 1110,1200 1200,1350
magnet, it's kind of just

138
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,170
0,90 90,750 750,1170 1590,1830 1830,2040
a glorified magnet, you know

139
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,430
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,630 630,1260
when you have two magnets

140
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,270
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,480 480,840
and you put them together,

141
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,050
0,120 120,330 330,390 390,570 570,780
you kind of feel that

142
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,300
0,420 420,870 870,1080
force between them.|

143
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,290
0,450 450,840 840,1110 1110,1380 1380,1560
That's all this is when

144
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,600
0,360 540,1200 1200,1440 1440,1950 1950,2310
I plug this big metal

145
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,490
0,600 810,1020 1020,1110 1110,1680 1680,1890
string, it is vibrating over

146
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,330
0,60 60,360 360,450 450,750 750,840
the top of that if

147
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,440
0,120 120,240 240,510 510,720 720,1110
you can see that Silver

148
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,420
0,450 450,780 1170,1530 1530,1650 1650,1980
circle there that is actually

149
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,680
0,120 120,510 540,720 720,810 810,1260
the tip of a magnet.|

150
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,300
0,450 1020,1200 1200,1350 1350,1800 1830,2070
Okay, so if I play

151
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,590
0,180 180,780 780,990 990,1050 1050,1290
my string over the top

152
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,150
0,60 60,240 240,660 1200,1500 1500,1560
of that string over the

153
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,680
0,270 270,330 330,540 540,1320 1320,1530
top of that pickup that

154
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,660
0,510 900,1080 1080,1620 1620,1800 1800,1980
magnet it translates that into

155
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,890
0,630 630,840 840,990 990,1020 1020,1230
electricity goes through a little

156
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,820
0,510 510,570 570,750 750,870 870,930
volume, a little bit of

157
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,660
0,450 600,720 720,900 900,1500
tone and that's basically.|

158
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,260
0,180 180,720 810,990 990,1140 1140,1200
Your guitar, there's not a

159
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,790
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,930 930,1530
whole lot of complex electronics

160
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,480
0,120 120,240 240,540 540,600 600,690
on the inside of your

161
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,830
0,450 630,720 720,1080 1080,1110 1110,1350
guitar, it's basically a couple

162
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,610
0,60 60,420 420,600 600,720 720,780
of wires hooked up to

163
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,680
0,210 210,720
these pickups.|

164
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,340
0,270 270,630 750,900 900,1170 1170,1440
But there's two different types

165
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,930
0,60 60,420 420,870 870,1380 1410,1590
of pickup single coil and

166
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,980
0,270 270,720
double coil.|

167
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,060
0,420 420,750 750,1410
Now really anything.|

168
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,410
0,540 540,810 810,1320 1350,1950 1950,2100
Mhm, that's metal vibrating over

169
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,380
0,180 180,720 750,1020 1020,1500
that pickup will work.|

170
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,760
0,240 240,330 330,750
Here I have.|

171
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,820
0,150 150,450 450,780 780,1260 1590,2040
My old tuning fork, okay

172
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,140
0,330 330,510 510,900
now when I.|

173
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,520
0,210 210,390 390,870 960,1230 1230,2070
Get this going it's vibrating.|

174
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,540
0,90 90,270 270,630 630,780 780,1350
And that pickup will sense.|

175
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,380
0,300 300,810 810,930 930,1350
That vibration as well.|

176
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,150
0,480 480,750 750,870 870,960 960,1230
Guitars usually have a three

177
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,050
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,750 750,900
way or a five way

178
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,460
0,570 840,1020 1020,1170 1170,1320 1320,1410
switch, if I'm all the

179
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,110
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,900 1440,1650
way up in front it's

180
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,500
0,270 270,360 360,660 660,1080
using the front pickup.|

181
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,970
0,90 90,210 210,360 360,420 420,540
If I'm all the way

182
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,710
0,60 60,120 120,570 840,1110 1110,1740
in the back it's listening

183
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,120
0,240 240,480 480,690 690,930 1260,1410
through this pick up through

184
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,620
0,60 60,300 300,750 1110,1440 1440,1500
the back pickup I'm in

185
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,360
0,60 60,570 840,1050 1050,1440 1440,1740
the middle it's generally using

186
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,010
0,210 210,630 870,1080 1080,1290 1290,1650
this pickup OK now regarding

187
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,720
0,510 900,1110 1110,1320 1320,1470 1470,1710
pickups, there's really only one

188
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,220
0,390 390,540 540,990 1110,1320 1320,1500
type of pickup, it's just

189
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,230
0,390 390,570 570,1080 1080,1500 1800,2010
basically this magnet, now they

190
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,820
0,480 480,780 780,1050 1050,1140 1140,1590
wind different kinds of winding

191
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,200
0,180 180,330 450,810 810,1050 1050,1380
on it, whine some more

192
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,670
0,270 270,510 510,900 1110,1350 1350,1470
wine, some less but you'll

193
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,320
0,360 390,810 810,1260 1260,1380 1380,1650
hear single coil and double

194
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,030
0,330 330,840 930,1410 1410,1620 1620,1710
coil pickups, basically all the

195
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,410
0,300 300,720 750,930 930,990 990,1380
double coil or a hum

196
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,720
0,480 480,1200 1500,1680 1680,2100 2100,2310
bucking pickup is basically to

197
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,630
0,360 360,870 900,2010 2160,2340 2340,2910
single coils, side-by-side or inverted

198
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,560
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,690 690,930
if you can imagine ones

199
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,310
0,210 210,450 450,540 540,600 600,750
like this and the other

200
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,120
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,630 630,810
one would be down like

201
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,640
0,390
this.|

202
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,510
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,750 750,1050
Okay, now the single coil

203
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,250
0,390 390,480 480,960 1080,1410 1410,1740
pickups are great, they just

204
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,330
0,240 240,570 570,720 720,870 870,930
we found out over the

205
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,290
0,480 480,630 630,720 720,780 780,960
years that they're a little

206
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,480
0,150 150,780 1290,1830 1860,2070 2070,2190
bit noisy, so when you

207
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,710
0,240 240,480 480,600 600,930 1050,1230
get two of them that's

208
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,520
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,570 570,810
why they put these hum

209
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
0,360 360,930 1230,1560 1560,1830 1830,1920
bucking pickups, they found out

210
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
0,120 120,480 480,960 960,1290 1620,1800
if you invert them, then

211
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,470
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,750 750,1230
they get a quieter signal,

212
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,610
0,180 180,390 390,480 480,750 750,960
so that's the difference between

213
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,090
0,60 60,210 210,330 330,450 450,480
the two they get a

214
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,190
0,360 360,780 780,960 960,1410 1680,2100
slightly difference in sound but

215
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,450
0,180 180,630 630,720 720,1020 1020,1230
it's basically the same thing

216
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,230
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,570 570,780
just one of them is

217
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,010
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,510 510,660
two of them and one

218
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,490
0,60 60,150 150,210 210,420 420,480
of them is one of

219
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:15,860
0,150
them.|

220
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,520
0,360 540,810 810,990 990,1170 1170,1470
Okay, now let's talk about

221
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,740
0,390 390,900 1260,1740 1800,2010 2010,2220
power chords, okay good old

222
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,240
0,240 240,330 330,570 570,930 930,1500
rock and roll stuff involves

223
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,700
0,450 450,960 1230,1650 1680,2100 2100,2460
power chords, okay, here's what

224
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,960
0,240 240,690 690,750 750,810 810,1170
is involved in a power

225
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
0,330 480,690 690,810 810,990 990,1200
chord, you may hear that

226
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
0,420 450,870 870,990 990,1050 1050,1320
term referred to a lot

227
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,020
0,150 150,270 270,300 300,480 480,540
and for a lot of

228
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,250
0,180 330,630 630,960 960,1140 1140,1230
things for many years I

229
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,210
0,150 150,450 630,840 840,900 900,960
didn't know what in the

230
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,140
0,210 210,270 270,360 360,660 660,930
world, they were talking about

231
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,940
0,630 630,780 780,1170 1170,1350 1350,1410
basically it's derived from the

232
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,200
0,480 480,1080
major scale.|

233
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,830
0,300 300,390 390,540 540,870 870,1320
Remember how our major triad

234
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,780
0,120 120,660 660,1200 1200,1380 1380,1950
was one three and five

235
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,670
0,240 240,300 300,720 720,1260 1620,1770
on a power cord, we

236
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,900
0,270 270,450 450,570 570,1020 1050,1230
take out the third and

237
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,680
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,660 660,780
so you're just left with

238
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,940
0,120 120,510 510,660 660,750 750,1260
the root and the fifth

239
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,890
0,210 210,840 960,1110 1110,1290 1290,1650
in c, it would be

240
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,600
0,120 120,750 870,1050 1050,1140 1140,1680
A C and A G

241
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,590
0,120 120,210 210,450 450,720 720,780
and I play those at

242
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,290
0,120 120,420 420,810 1140,1380 1380,2700
the same time, let me

243
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,030
0,270 270,420 420,870 870,1290 1590,1740
check my distortion there a

244
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,500
0,1410
cng.|

245
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,360
0,210 210,360 360,480 480,720 720,1200
If I'm in b flat,

246
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,990
0,90 90,210 210,330 330,420 420,630
it would be A B

247
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,540
0,450 450,2340 2340,2490
flat f F.|

248
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,300
0,150 150,630 750,870 870,960 960,1560
The root and the fifth

249
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,980
0,120 120,300 300,690 690,1140 1440,1650
in that particular key now

250
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,330
0,660 690,900 900,1110 1110,1290 1290,1350
sometimes you'll even have a

251
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,140
0,360 360,2700 2730,3180 3420,3660 3660,3810
chord form, I'll have the

252
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,220
0,390 390,630 630,810 810,930 930,1080
octave down here on this

253
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,090
0,210 210,360 360,630 630,750 750,870
c as well so you'll

254
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,870
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,480 480,780
see it as a three

255
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,980
0,270 270,540 540,600 600,990 990,1110
note chord or sometimes you'll

256
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,550
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,390 390,570
see it as a two

257
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,140
0,210 210,480 600,1260 1260,1380 1380,1590
note chord, it's a three

258
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,130
0,240 240,510 510,570 570,780 780,990
note chord I use all

259
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,620
0,480 750,1470 1470,1530 1530,2160 2190,2490
three it's a two note

260
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,700
0,180 180,240 240,480 480,720 720,1080
chord I just used to

261
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,780
0,270 270,420 420,540 540,780 780,930
either way is fine, either

262
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,340
0,330 360,540 540,840 840,1170 1170,1560
way or both power cords

263
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,050
0,420 510,720 720,840 840,1020 1020,1320
okay but you're only using

264
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,880
0,240 240,570 570,1020 1230,1380 1380,1830
two different tones, the route.|

265
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,350
0,180 180,270 270,810 1080,1470 1500,1950
And the fifth okay, most

266
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,580
0,270 270,570 570,750 750,1050 1050,1230
power chords are based off

267
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,540
0,90 90,480 480,690 690,810 810,960
of pivoting off of the

268
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,640
0,300 300,690 690,1800 1830,1920 1920,2100
fifth string as in this

269
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,760
0,300 300,1110 1320,2010 2010,2940 2970,3120
one C B flat or

270
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,390
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,540 540,630
you can also do it

271
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,760
0,150 150,240 240,570 570,990 1890,2370
off the six string f

272
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,160
0,210 210,1380 1380,1530 1530,1770 1770,2340
and g and very conveniently,

273
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,760
0,120 120,330 330,450 450,510 510,600
it works out to be

274
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,830
0,90 90,420 420,990 1230,1590 1800,2070
the same form, okay, let's

275
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,030
0,420 420,810 810,990 990,1050 1050,1200
practice jumping through a little

276
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,200
0,150 150,210 210,450 600,900 900,1170
bit of that, let's start

277
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,680
0,180 180,240 240,720 720,1320
on the sixth string.|

278
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,720
0,390 390,840 840,1380 1380,1710 1710,2190
Power cord movable form, first

279
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,770
0,270 270,480 480,570 570,660 660,810
okay, this would be like

280
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,710
0,150 150,390 390,750 750,1080 1440,2940
an f power chord, now

281
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,310
0,180 180,240 240,360 360,480 480,600
what do you do with

282
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,690
0,180 180,420 420,660 660,1170 1170,1380
these other three strings well

283
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,620
0,90 90,210 210,450 450,510 510,930
you're not supposed to blame

284
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,180
0,210 210,420 420,630 750,1110 1110,1290
either kind of mute them

285
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,860
0,420 420,900 1230,1440 1440,1560 1560,1680
down here, or you can

286
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,570
0,240 240,330 330,480 480,840 1320,1710
mute him with this hand

287
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,770
0,150 150,450 450,720 720,900 900,1200
as well, using this finger

288
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,270
0,270 270,360 360,900 900,1020 1020,1500
putting it down, but basically

289
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,960
0,90 90,270 270,420 420,510 510,690
you just try and keep

290
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,700
0,90 90,450 450,1200 1200,1500 1500,1740
a handle on not going

291
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,740
0,210 210,750 900,1680 1680,1800 1800,2040
too far down and not

292
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,420
0,210 210,390 390,690 690,1230 1500,1680
playing these extra strings, so

293
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,470
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,660 660,1050
this is an f power

294
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,760
0,450
chord.|

295
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,250
0,480 570,900 900,1140 1140,1440 1440,1710
Okay, now let's jump around

296
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,150
0,60 60,240 240,450 630,840 840,900
a little bit, if I

297
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,820
0,330 330,420 420,630 630,1320
wanted it in g.|

298
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,300
0,180 180,510 510,660 660,750 750,900
I pivot up to the

299
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,100
0,330 330,720 750,900 900,1710 1710,1800
third fret and play it

300
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,160
0,120 120,900
in g.|

301
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,290
0,210 210,300 300,570 570,720 720,840
If I wanted it in

302
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,380
0,720
c.|

303
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,710
0,120 120,240 240,330 330,570 570,720
I have to jump all

304
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,160
0,60 60,150 150,270 270,390 390,450
the way up here to

305
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,440
0,600 630,1650 1680,2070 2070,2160 2160,2280
see and play it and

306
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,450
0,1050 1080,1320 1320,1440 1440,1620 1620,2010
see see how that works,

307
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,590
0,300 300,390 390,480 480,750 750,1110
let's do a couple more

308
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,000
0,930
d.|

309
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,440
0,540 960,1200 1200,1380 1410,2070
Hmm, let's do a.|

310
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,960
0,1020
HMM.|

311
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,550
0,390 660,810 810,900 900,1050 1050,1110
Now, if I want to

312
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,120
0,90 90,150 150,240 240,300 300,570
do it on the fifth

313
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,990
0,390 420,630 630,720 720,780 780,870
string, let's do it on

314
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,040
0,90 90,270 270,660
the fifth string.|

315
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,780
0,570 570,750 750,900 900,1020 1020,1200
Hmm, this would be like

316
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,400
0,120 120,420 420,780 780,1110 1110,1620
your b power chord version,

317
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,950
0,420 540,990 990,1560 1740,1890 1890,2040
okay, same form I got

318
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,480
0,420 480,840 840,960 960,1260 1260,1530
one third and fourth right

319
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,610
0,360 660,1620 1620,1860 1860,2100 2100,2130
there let's jump around a

320
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,510
0,150 150,390 390,720 720,810 810,900
little bit, what if I

321
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,240
0,270 270,420 420,570 600,1380
wanted it in e.|

322
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,340
0,150 150,240 240,330 330,540 540,690
I have to jump all

323
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,990
0,60 60,180 180,300 300,750 750,1650
the way up here what

324
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,820
0,450
about.|

325
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,990
0,720 720,960 960,1170 1170,1710 2250,3900
Um, let's see g up

326
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,980
0,360 360,660 660,780 780,840 840,990
there what if I want

327
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,670
0,90 90,330 330,390 390,510 510,690
to g on the other

328
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,080
0,390
string.|

329
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,880
0,300 300,570 570,960 990,1770 1770,2700
Be down there OK now

330
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,020
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,990 990,1140
let's do some exercises with

331
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,460
0,150 660,990 1020,1200 1200,1290 1290,1440
him, okay now that we've

332
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,600
0,390 390,720 720,810 810,900 900,1140
practiced jumping in a couple

333
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,470
0,60 60,270 270,570 570,750 750,870
of different places with it,

334
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,880
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,900 900,1320
let's do our power cord

335
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,740
0,750 750,1110 1110,1500
exercise number one.|

336
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,850
0,450 930,1380 1380,1620 1620,1710 1710,1770
Okay starts off on A

337
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,800
0,360 360,840 1080,1560 1560,1650 1650,1950
C chord, sometimes you'll also

338
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,300
0,180 180,360 360,780 810,960 960,1500
see it written in notation

339
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,080
0,150 150,210 210,630 630,1440
as A C five.|

340
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,190
0,210 210,420 420,480 480,540 540,780
As opposed to A C

341
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,440
0,600 600,900 1260,1950 1950,2190 2190,2250
seventh or se man or

342
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,160
0,210 210,300 300,450 450,570 570,720
something like that, you'll see

343
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,180
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,870 870,1020
it as a c5 that's

344
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,960
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,660 660,780
trying to tell you, it's

345
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,550
0,60 60,480 480,840 1290,1440 1440,1590
a power chord okay, so

346
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,390
0,180 180,330 330,390 390,570 570,840
let's look at that first

347
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,950
0,570 900,1110 1110,1260 1260,1350 1350,1560
example, I'll do it for

348
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,210
0,210 210,570 600,870 870,1170 1170,1260
one time through nice and

349
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,020
0,540
slowly.|

350
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:50,350
0,720 1170,1710 2130,2730 3060,3810 3960,10980
One, two ready go zeph

351
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:59,020
0,840 840,2220 2850,4770 4800,6360 6510,8640
zeph do do rest rest.|

352
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,820
0,2220
MHM.|

353
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:09,310
0,2160 2700,5250 5370,5610 5610,5730 5730,5880
How how see how that

354
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,810
0,300 300,450 450,660 660,1200 1290,1500
works, we're just jumping from

355
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,920
0,360 360,450 450,780 780,1020 1020,1110
chord to chord using the

356
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,630
0,420 420,780 780,1290 1470,1650 1650,1710
same form again I'm a

357
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,530
0,390 390,600 600,660 660,810 810,900
guitar player I like the

358
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,880
0,480 480,630 630,690 690,990 990,1350
simplest way of doing things,

359
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,410
0,210 210,330 330,630 630,840 840,1230
that's why guitar players love

360
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,000
0,990 990,1350 1350,1410 1410,1500 1500,1590
power cords, we don't have

361
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,080
0,90 90,240 240,420 420,810 810,1080
to worry about major minor

362
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,890
0,30 30,360 360,480 480,630 630,810
or anything, we just have

363
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,540
0,90 90,450
to do.|

364
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,840
0,540 570,840 840,990 990,1170 1170,1230
We just have doom on

365
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,590
0,90 90,360 360,420 420,480 480,750
the fifth of the fourth

366
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,000
0,450 600,900 900,990 990,1080 1080,1410
string fifth of the six

367
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,350
0,420 630,780 780,870 870,1050 1050,1350
string and do that power

368
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,880
0,240 240,600 810,1140 1170,1410 1410,1530
cord form okay, let's do

369
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,080
0,150 150,300 300,870
one more example.|

370
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,650
0,360 360,450 450,600 600,930 1020,1320
Before we do that there

371
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,450
0,210 210,420 450,900 900,1320 1320,1800
are some open power chords,

372
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,470
0,150 150,420 420,480 480,570 570,1020
I've taught you the movable

373
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,460
0,270 270,330 330,420 420,690 690,990
ones on the fifth string

374
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,750
0,120 120,180 180,510 510,870 1020,1290
on the sixth string now

375
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,680
0,180 180,330 330,420 420,570 600,930
let's look at an open

376
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,550
0,240 270,450 450,510 510,720 720,870
one if I want an

377
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,080
0,390 390,660 660,1230
eap, our cord.|

378
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,840
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,930 960,1410
It would just be open

379
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,720
0,480
e.|

380
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,620
0,150 150,270 270,570 570,1200
And it be Annie.|

381
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,000
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,570 570,780
Which, if you can see

382
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
0,150 150,150 150,600 600,960 960,1200
if I moved everything up

383
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,790
0,150 150,390 390,1080 1320,1470 1470,1590
a half step there would

384
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,600
0,120 120,300 300,570 570,690 690,810
be my f so it's

385
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,670
0,210 210,270 270,1260 1260,1860 1890,2070
really the same chord, we

386
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,510
0,180 180,360 360,450 450,570 570,840
just have it in open

387
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,800
0,720 750,870 870,990 990,1140 1140,1290
form, the other one is

388
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,340
0,120 120,720 1170,1200 1230,2430
an a or a.|

389
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,480
0,450 450,570 570,780 780,840 840,990
Okay, and again I could

390
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,410
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,870 870,930
do all three strings or

391
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,600
0,210 210,1560 1590,1950 1950,2010 2010,2190
just two whatever I want

392
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,160
0,60 60,270 270,390 390,630 1020,1560
to do on that okay

393
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,270
0,300 300,480 480,570 570,840 840,1020
let's look at power chord

394
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,800
0,540 540,840 840,1260 1260,1410 1410,1530
exercise number three and go

395
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,020
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,900
through that one together.|

396
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,190

these links, it takes a

495
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,770
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,930 960,1110
little bit of time to

496
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,180
0,360 360,450 450,660 660,1020 1020,1410
figure out these open strings

497
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,050
0,90 90,240 240,540 540,780 780,870
but it's well worth it

498
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,590
0,60 60,210 210,240 240,450 450,540
to get a few of

0,1440 3990,4320 4320,4620 4620,4800 4800,4890
problem country guitar playing is

508
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,400
0,330 330,600 600,900 900,1140 1140,1500
almost always done, good guitar

0,120 150,480
and e.|

511
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,700
0,330 420,600 600,660 660,780 780,840
Good, now I want to

512
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,780
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,810 810,1080
talk about one more style

513
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,800
0,60 60,390 390,630 630,690 780,1020
of guitar playing a little

514
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,270
0,90 90,450 600,1020 1020,1140 1140,1470
bit about rhythm and Blues

515
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,650
0,360 360,540 540,690 690,1020 1050,1380
about r and b funk

516
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,090
0,360 360,690 780,990 990,1230 1230,1440
guitar playing we talked about

517
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,900
0,180 180,270 270,510 510,630 630,810
this a little bit when

518
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,520
0,90 90,300 300,510 510,1140 1140,1620
we're talking about muted picking

519
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,380
0,270 270,570 810,1140 1140,1560 1560,1620
but let me emphasize a

520
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,460
0,240 240,300 300,540 540,840 840,1080
couple of different things for

521
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:52,920
0,180
you.|

522
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,950
0,210 210,360 360,600 600,1170 1170,1800
It's a real percussive style

523
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,030
0,210 210,300 300,450 450,510 510,630
so you want to make

524
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,840
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,480 480,810
sure you have a nice

525
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,670
0,300 300,720 720,1110 1440,1680 1680,1830
good thick pick and as

526
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,940
0,180 180,840
I'm playing.|

527
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,920
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,420 420,660
Let me kind of switch

528
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,050
0,420 420,780 1260,1860 1860,1950 1950,2130
pickups here because I just

529
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,920
0,210 210,510 510,1290 1320,3600 3630,3870
play this a if I

530
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,060
0,270 270,630 630,870 870,930 930,1140
play hard enough I kind

531
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,480
0,60 60,210 210,1020 1260,2070 2070,3420
of get zip popping sound

532
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:23,900
0,1230 1620,1740 1740,2010 2010,2460
so I'm just playing.|

533
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,570
0,450 480,510 540,900 900,1020 1020,1410
Okay, a little bit about

534
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,520
0,480 480,600 600,900 900,1290 1380,1560
rhythm and Blues playing they

535
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,360
0,150 150,240 240,480 480,570 570,840
use a lot of that

536
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,320
0,300 300,360 360,570 570,660 660,900
instead of playing a full

537
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,190
0,270 270,390 390,600 600,810 810,870
chord they'll just use a

538
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,270
0,180 180,360 360,600 600,660 660,1080
little bit part of accord,

539
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,530
0,330 330,540 540,690 690,870 870,1020
let only play one more

540
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:56,770
0,390 390,720 23400,23730 23730,23940 23940,24240
example for something like that.|

541
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:57,760
0,210 210,360 360,390 390,510 510,570
They use a lot of

542
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,170
0,450 450,780 780,990 1050,1350 1350,1410
palm muting a lot of

543
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,220
0,360 360,420 420,750 750,990 990,1050
taking the quarter part, we

544
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,500
0,240 240,450 450,1050 1320,1860 1920,2280
talked about earlier and um,

545
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,880
0,180 180,450 450,870 870,990 990,1380
they used sliding of fourths

546
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
0,150 150,720
and fifths.|

547
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,340
0,300 300,420 420,570 570,660 660,1260
Which, if I'm in A

548
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,100
0,150 150,390 390,1020 1050,2910
I just slide up.|

549
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,080
0,180 180,240 240,360 360,420 420,510
Kind of do it on

550
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,070
0,90 90,540 690,780 780,840 840,990
the road than I do

551
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,880
0,90 90,180 180,1110
on the fifth.|

552
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,310
0,150 150,360 360,630 630,900 900,990
They use last style, a

553
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,440
0,270 540,990 1380,1770 1800,1980 1980,2130
lot, okay now let's talk

554
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,400
0,60 60,210 210,330 330,570 570,960
a little bit about guitar

555
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,380
0,600 810,1170 1170,1500 1500,1800 1800,1980
effects electric guitar players use

556
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,520
0,150 150,390 390,480 480,840 900,1140
them all the time, there's

557
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,890
0,420 420,630 630,1230 1470,2160 2160,2370
basically some basic common ones

558
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,030
0,120 120,180 180,600 600,930 930,1140
that are similar between all

559
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,590
0,270 270,630 630,1020 1140,1440 1440,1560
different effect boards that you

560
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,820
0,150 150,240 240,630 660,900 900,1230
need to have in your

561
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,720
0,510 510,570 570,660 660,840 840,900
artillery to be able to

562
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,240
0,270
get.|

563
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,990
0,390 690,1200 1200,1410 1410,1470 1470,1590
Okay first thing I want

564
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,760
0,60 60,240 240,630 660,870 870,1770
to talk about is distortions

565
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,130
0,510 600,900 900,1500 1500,1890 1890,2160
okay, I've got several different

566
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,360
0,510 510,690 690,780 780,930 930,1230
distortions here on my pedal

567
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,300
0,420 750,1320 1320,2190 2190,2310 2310,2940
board, um, if I crank.|

568
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,930
0,2520 2910,2940 2940,3150 3150,3240 3240,3600
{Giscard's -} up the sound

569
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,100
0,60 60,270 270,510 1440,3480 3870,4170
a little bit of some

570
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,690
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,660 660,1590
of them have different characteristics.|

571
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,200
0,150 150,420 420,540 540,750 750,870
We switch over this one

572
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,870
0,330 2130,2280 2280,2460 2460,2490 2490,2670
here that wants a little

573
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,610
0,210 210,720 720,840 840,1500 1530,1740
more softer and mellower use

574
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,590
0,180 180,750 750,870 870,1230 1230,1980
them differently in different situations,

575
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,580
0,330 330,480 480,720 720,780 780,840
let me talk to you

576
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,350
0,180 180,600 810,1470 1470,1680 1680,1770
about one specific type of

577
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,030
0,480 960,1140 1140,1320 1320,1470 1470,1680
pedal and I been s

578
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,680
0,300 300,840 1080,1350 1350,1500 1500,1650
tube screamer, okay, this has

579
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,670
0,150 150,450 450,570 570,900 900,990
been around for years and

580
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,750
0,300 300,510 510,870 870,960 960,1080
probably will continue to be

581
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,890
0,360 360,480 480,810 810,900 900,1140
around for years and years

582
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,870
0,90 90,450 900,1440 1530,1710 1710,1980
and years now you'll notice

583
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,670
0,480 480,810 810,1050 1050,1440 1440,1800
distortion pedals have several things

584
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,620
0,150 150,630 810,1140 1140,1470 1770,1950
in common, they have a

585
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,520
0,750
drive.|

586
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,210
0,120 120,240 240,540 540,810 810,1050
And they also have a

587
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,680
0,450 450,870 900,1020 1020,1350 1350,1470
level knob or sometimes you'll

588
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,270
0,180 180,270 270,420 420,960 1260,1590
see it as game think

589
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,800
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,720 1170,1530
of it this way a

590
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,400
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,510 510,600
think of it like a

591
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,520
0,330 330,810
water hose.|

592
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,310
0,450 600,930 930,1530 1560,1740 1740,2160
Hey the drive is what's

593
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,770
0,270 270,930 1380,1710 1710,2040 2040,2310
your initial what's coming into

594
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,210
0,90 90,660 900,1110 1110,1230 1230,1440
the system, and you can

595
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,770
0,330 330,660 660,810 810,1140 1140,1560
really boost that water hose

596
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,500
0,480 780,960 960,1410 1560,1950 1950,2430
OK the one the level

597
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,940
0,120 120,210 210,600 600,1140 1230,1410
or the volume on is

598
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,320
0,180 180,360 360,720 720,990 990,1380
how much you're actually letting

599
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,640
0,240 270,420 420,630 630,870 870,1320
out of that big signal,

600
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,260
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,990 990,1290
so I can control whether

601
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,400
0,150 150,390 390,510 510,780 780,1140
I'm having a little signal

602
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,990
0,270 270,420 420,510 510,1050 1230,1590
coming into the system or

603
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,400
0,120 120,720 720,1020 1020,1260 1260,1410
a huge signal coming into

604
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,020
0,60 60,510 600,900 900,1290 1290,1620
the system, but nothing comes

605
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,490
0,420 660,990 990,1110 1110,1410 1410,1470
out until I open the

606
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,080
0,390 390,510 510,750 750,1080 1410,1590
spigot on this end and

607
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,100
0,210 210,330 330,750 750,900 900,1020
let out whatever so if

608
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,300
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,870 870,1200
I have this huge signal

609
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,590
0,270 270,720 870,1080 1080,1110 1110,1290
coming here then I gotta

610
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,340
0,150 150,330 330,390 390,570 570,750
make sure I have my

611
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,650
0,510 510,960 1230,2010 2010,2100 2100,2310
volume down appropriately are going

612
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,880
0,60 60,180 180,390 390,930 930,1230
to get this massive signal

613
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,020
0,330 330,540 720,960 960,1080 1080,1140
coming out, so if I

614
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,280
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,600 600,1260
want to be really distorted

615
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,600
0,180 180,510 510,720 720,1080 1080,1230
I crank this gain all

616
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,100
0,90 90,270 270,540 870,1230 1230,1500
the way up get really

617
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,300
0,540 540,750 750,870 870,990 990,1200
distorted really where it's really

618
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,500
0,330 330,540 540,810 810,930 930,1200
breaking up, but I only

619
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,460
0,180 180,240 240,660 660,660 660,960
want to allow a little

620
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,030
0,150 150,240 240,330 330,540 540,570
bit of it out or

621
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,540
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,390 390,510
I'm going to have this

622
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,530
0,180 180,420 420,510 510,570 570,990
too much of a massive

623
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,080
0,420
signal.|

624
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,640
0,60 60,150 150,240 240,450 450,930
It would be too loud,

625
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,300
0,90 90,90 90,360 360,480 480,540
if I just want a

626
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,410
0,210 210,360 360,420 420,990 990,1110
little bit of distortion, or

627
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,400
0,210 210,270 270,390 390,540 540,990
maybe I don't want distortion

628
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,690
0,60 60,450 510,870 870,1050 1050,1290
at all crank this down

629
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,590
0,240 240,330 330,480 480,600 600,900
nice and low and open

630
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,820
0,180 180,360 360,600 750,1110 1110,1230
this one up nice and

631
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,460
0,360
big.|

632
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,200
0,210 210,270 270,690 690,1050 1050,1500
That's a relationship between gain

633
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
0,180 180,660 930,1260 1260,1530 1530,1680
and volume, another pedal that

634
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,810
0,120 120,270 270,570 570,840 840,930
is real common habit is

635
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,190
0,60 60,510 510,900 990,1200 1200,1380
a chorus pedal what it's

636
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,880
0,390 390,510 510,570 570,630 630,690
doing, let me see if

637
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,420
0,90 90,180 180,270 270,330 330,540
I can get a good

638
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,990
0,390 390,840 1410,1830 1830,5040 5100,6570
chorus sound here's my if

639
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,420
0,120 120,330 330,990
I had chorus.|

640
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,940
0,1860
OH.|

641
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,520
0,570 570,1650 1650,1770 1770,2190 2190,2280
Courses expand your sound a

642
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
0,210 210,450 840,1140 1140,1320 1320,1920
little bit, now there's choruses

643
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,600
0,150 150,660 660,930 1320,1830 1830,2160
and flange ers and phase

644
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,740
0,360 360,540 540,750 750,810 810,1140
shifters they're all the same

645
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,790
0,210 210,360 360,600 600,750 750,1050
sort of thing it's taking

646
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,470
0,120 120,510 750,1080 1260,1590 1590,1680
your sound and taking a

647
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,430
0,180 180,330 330,630 630,780 780,960
little bit sharp little bit

648
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,630
0,390 390,540 540,870 870,960 960,1200
flat and making it into

649
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,040
0,90 90,570 720,930 930,1020 1020,1410
a pleasant you can control

650
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,480
0,210 210,450 450,930 930,1350 1350,1440
how much it's diverting the

651
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,720
0,360 360,420 420,750 810,3450
sound or not, um.|

652
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,280
0,300 300,450 450,750 750,960 960,1080
Next thing everybody needs to

653
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,060
0,240 240,420 420,600 600,690 690,780
have some sort of a

654
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,020
0,600
delay.|

655
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,540
0,450 480,660 660,930 930,1020 1020,1350
Okay, I'm using a regular

656
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,880
0,270 270,840 1110,1770 1770,2130 2130,2340
old boss digital delay here

657
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,800
0,270 600,1080 1080,1500 1500,1740 1740,1920
there's more exciting ones than

658
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,970
0,300 300,510 510,870 870,990 990,1170
this, but basically they all

659
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,660
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,390 390,690
kind of do the same

660
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,250
0,330 480,750 750,960 960,1080 1080,1590
thing I play my note.|

661
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,350
0,210 210,360 360,600 600,1020 1020,1470
And it fought trails off.|

662
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,940
0,210 210,390 390,900 900,1170 1170,1680
I can control how much.|

663
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
0,270 270,690 690,1170
It's feeding back.|

664
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,160
0,450 450,780 780,960 960,1200 1200,1290
How loud that needs to

665
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,480
0,360 690,900 900,1020 1020,1170 1170,1320
be I can make it

666
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
0,630
feedback.|

667
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,920
0,360 360,480 480,540 540,960
Forever, if I wanted.|

668
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,080
0,180 180,450 450,570 570,660 660,750
And also when you do

669
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,800
0,270 270,390 390,570 570,630 630,720
something like that you can

670
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,820
0,150 150,300 300,360 360,510 510,1020
get kind of neat effects.|

671
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:47,800
0,8340
ZA.|

672
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,180
0,960
Yeah.|

673
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,950
0,390 420,570 570,780 780,810 810,960
Okay, so that's a little

674
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,590
0,90 90,510 990,1620 1620,1920 1920,2640
bit about reverb zin delays,

675
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,030
0,300 330,750 750,870 870,1140 1140,1320
okay reverb is more like

676
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,290
0,150 150,690 870,1110 1110,1170 1170,1260
an echo like you would

677
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,380
0,180 180,240 240,330 330,810
hear in a room.|

678
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,920
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,810 810,1020
Me crying my reverb up

679
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,360
0,420 1140,2760 3900,4140 4140,4200 4200,4410
kind of makes it sound

680
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,930
0,150 150,240 240,300 300,360 360,570
like you're in a big

681
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,310
0,450 750,870 870,990 990,1170 1170,1380
place to talk about one

682
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,510
0,300 570,810 810,960 960,1050 1050,1200
more k now I'm gonna

683
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,530
0,150 150,270 270,720 720,810 810,1020
use my waffle a little

684
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,110
0,210 420,870 1380,2280 2280,2460 2460,2580
bit okay, okay, let's see

685
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,500
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,1830
what can I do.|

686
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:29,960
0,660 1410,1980 2520,3210
No no, no.|

687
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,940
0,270 300,480 480,570 570,780 780,1020
A little bit about using

688
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,900
0,120 120,360 360,570 570,840 840,960
your wap, hell takes a

689
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,490
0,540 570,780 780,1080 1110,1530 1530,1590
while to get used to

690
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,600
0,120 120,600 600,690 690,900 900,1110
the feel of how that

691
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,980
0,510 510,870 960,1200 1200,1290 1290,1380
cycles through but it's a

692
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,690
0,390 390,720 720,1260 1260,1590 1620,1710
great effect, especially in a

693
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,620
0,360 360,660 660,720 720,810 810,930
funk playing you can get

694
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,370
0,60 60,270 270,330 330,480 480,750
a lot of good use

695
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,040
0,90 90,180 180,600 990,1410
out of oz, okay.|

696
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,010
0,300 300,450 450,540 540,630 630,750
Now let's go to our

697
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,560
0,150 150,450 450,720 720,1230
how music works section.|

698
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,680
0,300 300,660 660,1050 1050,1110 1110,1350
OK very quickly I wanted

699
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,550
0,90 90,360 360,480 480,570 570,870
to touch on a very

700
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,160
0,450 450,1320 1320,1620 1620,1680 1680,2610
important concept called the harmonized

701
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,680
0,540 540,1200
major scale.|

702
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,170
0,420 420,540 540,900 900,1170 1170,1260
Not so important about the

703
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,370
0,480 570,870 870,930 930,1110 1110,1200
name, but I want you

704
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,050
0,60 60,810 810,1080 1080,1620 1620,1680
to understand the concept of

705
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,980
0,240 240,510 510,690 690,840 840,930
what's going on, if I

706
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,390
0,210 210,270 270,660 660,1260 1260,1410
take a major scale let's

707
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,740
0,180 180,240 240,510 510,900 900,1350
say A C major scale.|

708
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,200
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,450 450,840
And I'm going to build

709
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,220
0,420 420,480 480,600 600,690 690,1020
things I'm going to stack

710
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,690
0,570 570,900 900,1020 1200,1380 1380,1470
two-thirds above it so I

711
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,010
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,840 840,1320
actually have a major triad

712
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,510
0,150 150,510 510,840 840,990 990,1500
a one three and five.|

713
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,430
0,270 270,330 330,810 810,1230 1230,1440
Then I stack thirds on

714
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,420
0,300 300,360 360,630 630,870 870,990
all of those going all

715
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,440
0,60 60,180 180,300 300,420 420,1020
the way up the scale

716
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,730
0,120 120,240 240,600 600,900 900,1050
well the first step, if

717
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,050
0,60 60,420 420,990 1080,1200 1200,1320
I didn't see it would

718
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,240
0,300 690,1200 1230,1590 1590,1740 1740,2190
be one three and five

719
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,620
0,180 180,630 630,840 840,960 960,1380
or C E and g.|

720
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,230
0,210 210,450 450,570 570,630 630,780
Which comes out to be

721
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,800
0,60 60,360 360,690 690,1290
A C major triumph.|

722
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,340
0,120 120,180 180,450 450,660 660,840
And the next one I

723
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,330
0,120 120,360 390,660 660,900 900,990
would be two four and

724
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,220
0,390 390,600 600,720 720,990 1290,1890
six which would be D

725
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,110
0,480 510,720 750,1200 1590,1740 1740,1890
F and a well now

726
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,860
0,150 150,240 240,540 540,660 660,750
if you notice if you

727
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,270
0,240 240,450 450,570 570,990 1020,1410
just look at that D

728
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,320
0,300 300,420 420,690 690,780 780,1050
F and a and think

729
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,830
0,60 60,150 150,240 240,300 300,510
of it in the key

730
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,580
0,120 120,330 330,570 570,690 690,750
of d just for a

731
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,140
0,420 750,960 960,1230 1230,1440 1440,1560
second, it doesn't turn out

732
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,070
0,90 90,180 180,570 570,780 780,930
to be major turn out

733
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,320
0,90 90,270 270,1020
to be minor.|

734
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,780
0,180 180,450 450,750 750,960 960,1110
A one flat three and

735
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,190
0,510 720,900 900,1020 1020,1260 1260,1410
five if I'm looking at

736
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,030
0,60 60,120 120,360 360,450 450,840
in the key of d,

737
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,890
0,120 120,330 330,840 1050,1260 1260,1740
it's very important, the second

738
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,120
0,540 600,750 750,1080 1080,1200 1200,1230
step will get you a

739
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,700
0,570 660,1230
minor triad.|

740
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,650
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,360 360,420
If I go to the

741
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,910
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,660 690,1260
next one I get e.g.

742
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,860
0,150 150,540
and b.|

743
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,610
0,300 300,510 510,840 840,1050 1050,1170
OK that also ends up

744
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,280
0,240 240,330 330,720 720,1290
being a minor triad.|

745
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,720
0,120 120,810
The fourth.|

746
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,560
0,300 300,540 540,660 660,1170 1230,1410
F A and c is

747
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,840
0,270 270,360 360,990
back to major.|

748
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,380
0,750 750,1110 1110,1200 1200,1650 1650,1950
Fifth back to major G

749
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,580
0,240 240,360 360,870
B and d.|

750
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,280
0,870 870,1170 1170,1290 1290,1710 1740,1980
Sixth back to minor A

751
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,500
0,330 330,510 510,870
C and e.|

752
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,790
0,780 1170,1620 1620,2370 2400,2790 2790,2970
Seventh be dnf actually ends

753
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,500
0,150 150,510 510,690 690,1350 1350,1710
up being a diminished triad,

754
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,220
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,570 570,720
if you look at it

755
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,660
0,420 420,630 630,690 690,960 960,1290
based off of that be.|

756
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,620
0,450 450,810 810,1110 1110,1740 1950,2370
This becomes real important, some

757
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,880
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,900 930,1260
of them are major, some

758
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,260
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,930 1140,1380
of them are minor in

759
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,180
0,330 330,750 750,1050 1050,1500 1500,1920
any key any major key

760
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,650
0,210 210,720 750,930 930,1110 1110,1440
it's A B that same

761
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,600
0,720 870,1110 1110,1320 1320,1380 1380,1950
relationship which ones are major,

762
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,730
0,120 120,600 600,1110 1410,1590 1590,2040
the one chord the four

763
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,590
0,510 750,960 960,1080 1080,1470 1470,1860
chord and the five chord.|

764
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,820
0,240 240,480 480,540 540,840 840,1050
Which ones are mine or

765
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,350
0,120 120,420 420,900 1020,1140 1140,1470
the two chord, the three

766
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,450
0,450 540,690 690,1050 1050,1440 1920,2100
chord, the six chord and

767
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,770
0,240 240,420 420,810 1020,1200 1200,1320
one that's off is the

768
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,810
0,570 570,870 870,1500 1710,1980 1980,2040
seventh that's diminished that's a

769
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,390
0,630 630,930 930,1350 1350,2010 2310,2580
harmonized major scale concept very

770
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,770
0,390 390,510 510,630 630,1110 1110,1380
important I would practice that

771
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,030
0,150 150,510 510,870 870,930 930,1020
in different keys, you can

772
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,810
0,120 120,210 210,510 510,570 570,780
get an idea of how

773
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,220
0,210 210,720 900,1140 1140,1320 1320,1410
that flows one four one

774
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,660
0,330 330,420 420,900 990,1230 1230,1440
five a major two three

775
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,800
0,90 90,420 420,480 480,960
and six are minor.|

776
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,070
0,330 360,510 510,660 660,810 810,930
Okay, let's talk about your

777
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,540
0,390 390,480 480,660 660,900 1290,1470
