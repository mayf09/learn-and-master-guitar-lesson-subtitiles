Okay, the first thing we

41
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,550

0,360 360,750 750,840 840,1230 1230,1680
Most guitars are pretty similar

44
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,140
0,90 90,240 240,810 990,1500 1500,1620
in their design, this in

52
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,840
0,240 240,510 510,690 690,990 990,1680
Your guitar has six strings.|

53
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,700
0,180 180,540 540,630 630,840 840,990
They're attached on this end

54
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,530
0,120 120,210 210,600 600,1170 1530,1830
by the tuning keys down

55
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,310
0,90 90,300 300,540 540,690 690,780
on this end by the

56
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,180
0,450 450,600 600,660 660,780 780,870
bridge there's a lot of

57
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,900
0,420 420,570 570,750 750,1350
tension on this bridge.|

58
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,030
0,90 90,270 270,390 390,450 450,570
You always want to make

59
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,890
0,210 210,540 840,1200 1200,1620 1620,1860
sure that's a attach nice

60
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,000

and tight to your sound

61
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,920
0,150 150,210 210,300 300,780 1530,1920
board of your guitar, sometimes

62
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,150
0,90 90,300 300,390 390,540 540,1230
your guitar will have a

63
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,560
0,300 300,570 570,960 1080,1320 1320,1380
pick guard here so it

64
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,550
0,210 210,540 540,630 630,750 750,990
doesn't scratch up your guitar

65
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,290
0,90 90,210 210,600 720,1320 1320,1740
when you play these Silver

66
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,300
0,690
bars.|

67
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,610
0,120 120,180 180,480 480,870 870,1050
And the gold bars are

68
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,640
0,570
frets.|

69
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,190
0,270 270,420 420,630 630,690 690,1020
We will learn an awful

70
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,480
0,210 210,480 480,810 810,930 930,1290
lot about frets and where

71
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,430
0,870 1050,1350 1350,1410 1410,1650 1650,1740
to where to put your

72
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,540
0,360 360,540 540,720 750,930 930,1110
fingers on them as well

73
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,380
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,540 540,840
as on the fret board.|

74
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,930
0,210 210,480 480,570 570,840 840,900
So that's the parts of

75
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,400
0,90 90,630 840,1020 1020,1290 1290,1470
the guitar, the next thing

76
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,540
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,720 960,1140
we need to learn is

77
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,920
0,120 120,510 510,600 600,750 750,1380
the names of our strings.|

78
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,620
0,120 120,240 240,540 540,870 870,960
You have six strings on

79
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,480
0,30 30,540
a guitar.|

80
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,580
0,60 60,330 330,450 450,750 750,900
Of course it's first through

81
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,110
0,330 330,450 450,690 720,1320 1320,1530
six but they're numbered from

82
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,060
0,90 90,660 660,1230 1680,1860 1860,1950
the thinnest string which is

83
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,560
0,330 330,420 420,810 810,1080
actually the bottom one.|

84
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,630
0,300 300,570 570,690 690,1290 1470,1650
Up through the thickest which

85
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,470
0,90 90,210 210,510 510,660 660,840
is the top one, so

86
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,640
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,600 600,1170
this would be the first.|

87
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,260
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,540 540,1080
This should be the second.|

88
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,680
0,810
Third.|

89
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,580
0,120 120,390 390,720
And so on.|

90
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,120
0,240 240,360 360,630 630,810 810,1080
Now, they also have letter

91
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,200
0,330 330,480 480,630 630,900 900,1080
names that go along with

92
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,060
0,180
them.|

93
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,370
0,150 150,540 540,1080 1380,1740 1740,1890
The musical alphabet goes from

94
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,820
0,300 300,450 450,1020
a to g.|

95
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,320
0,180 180,390 390,720 720,960 960,1260
So there's different letter names

96
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,430
0,120 120,660 660,810 810,960 960,1110
that correspond with each one

97
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,300
0,60 60,240 240,570 570,660 660,870
of these strings and that's

98
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,650
0,630 630,690 690,780 780,1110 1110,1350
one of the first things

99
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,760
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,690 870,1110
we need to learn, so

100
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,120
0,180 180,390 390,570 570,1020
let's learn that first.|

101
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,700
0,150 150,270 270,330 330,420 420,750
We're going to do three

102
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,770
0,390 390,480 480,540 540,1050 1740,2070
strings at a time when

103
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,730
0,180 210,510 510,600 600,720 720,960
I when we do more

104
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,350
0,270 270,540 540,1080 1080,1470 1470,1620

0,300 300,690 780,1170 1170,1410 1410,1830
you'll find unless it's anchored

209
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,870
0,570 1020,1290 1290,1290 1290,1530 1530,1770
somewhere, so a good place

210
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,670
0,120 120,600 630,1260 1260,1560 1560,1800
to start different guitar players

211
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,480
0,90 90,180 180,480 480,690 690,810
do it different ways but

212
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,230
0,30 30,180 180,390 390,480 480,750
a good place to start

213
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,920
0,90 90,210 210,420 420,600 600,690
is to just put your

214
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,480
0,510 780,960 960,1080 1080,1200 1200,1560
pinky and let it touch

215
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,520
0,90 90,510 510,810
the sound board.|

216
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,200
0,270 270,390 390,570 570,1020 1020,1200
I don't really particularly care

217
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,160
0,510 510,600 600,660 660,840 840,960
where and it doesn't have

218
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
0,90 90,330 330,660 690,1020 1020,1200
to touch hard just needs

219
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,290
0,90 90,420 420,510 510,690 690,930
to touch it just helps

220
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,730
0,120 120,510 510,870 900,1290 1290,1440
your hand know where it's

221
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,050
0,360 480,720 720,930 930,1050 1050,1320
at and what it needs

222
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,610
0,90 90,510 780,990 990,1260 1290,1560
to do all right let's

223
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,260
0,240 240,390 870,1260 1260,1320 1320,1650
try and pick a couple

224
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,730
0,150 150,360 360,690 690,1260 1260,1470
of these different strings and

225
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,960
0,120 120,270 270,750 750,1140 1140,1230
get some practice picking the

226
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,740
0,540
strings.|

227
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,520
0,450 450,870 900,1050 1050,1440 1440,1950
Let's do the first string

228
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,820
0,150 150,660
you ready.|

229
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,340
0,300 300,720 840,2190 2220,2730
Let's go go go.|

230
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,500
0,450 900,1080 1080,1260 1260,1380 1380,1710
Okay, what about the third

231
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,460
0,360 480,660 660,720 720,900 900,960
string, what's the name of

232
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,900
0,150 150,390 390,840 1290,1380 1380,1440
that third string do you

233
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,780
0,600
remember.|

234
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,140
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,510 510,810
Here we go, the third

235
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,440
0,540 540,2220
strings east.|

236
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,000
0,1080
HMM.|

237
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,120
0,540 540,960 1530,1650 1650,1950 1950,2460
Very good, the fifth string.|

238
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,400
0,60 60,120 120,2310 2730,3600
Do you remember one.|

239
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,900
0,300 300,600 1140,1830 1860,2100 2100,2220
Very good, now that's the

240
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,920
0,240 240,540 540,690 690,840 840,1020
right hand let's talk about

241
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
0,90 90,360 360,570 570,690 690,1080
the left hand as well.|

242
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,710
0,540 540,690 690,810 810,870 870,1020
Left hand, this is going

243
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,280
0,60 60,150 150,240 240,480 480,570
to be the hand that

244
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,820
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,330 330,540
you're going to be using

245
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,020
0,120 120,480 480,570 570,900 900,1200
to fret the different notes

246
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,620
0,240
with.|

247
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,490
0,330 330,540 540,840 840,960 960,1140
How this works as far

248
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,600
0,120 120,210 210,540 540,630 630,1110
as the guitar is concerned,

249
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,040
0,150 150,420 420,750 750,1260 1260,1440
you've got four fingers on

250
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,660
0,180 180,630 960,1230 1230,1410 1410,1620
this hand, you don't really

251
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,200
0,210 210,330 330,600 600,1080
use your thumb some.|

252
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,190
0,600 750,990 990,1290 1290,1590 1590,1740
Players some country players do

253
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,120
0,270 270,420 420,660 660,750 750,930
use their thumb to kind

254
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,930
0,60 60,300 300,480 480,600 600,810
of reach over and catch

255
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,610
0,120 120,210 210,360 630,1320 1320,1680
some of the lower bass

256
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,680
0,450 570,870 870,1050 1050,1680 1680,2070
notes but it's pretty tricky

257
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,970
0,120 120,360 360,750 750,1050 1050,1290
to do that and not

258
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,500
0,180 180,390 390,570 570,1140 1260,1530
really all that effective so

259
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,190
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,540 540,690
we're gonna go ahead and

260
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,120
0,390 390,660 660,1020 1020,1620
bring that risk down.|

261
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,200
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,1290
And put this handout.|

262
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,660
0,330 330,870 870,1200 1200,1590
Like such you want.|

263
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,680
0,240 240,480 480,600 600,720 720,780
Make sure you want to

264
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,640
0,150 150,330 330,420 420,720 720,960
make sure that there's air

265
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,080
0,420 420,630 630,960 1170,1350 1350,1440
space right here you don't

266
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,920
0,180 180,360 360,600 600,690 690,840
want your wrist to be

267
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,360
0,270 270,420 420,660 660,1110
way up like this.|

268
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,440
0,180 180,570 570,660 660,1050 1050,1350
Or gripping the guitar very

269
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,940
0,270 270,480 480,720 1110,1410 1410,1500
hard like that needs to

270
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,930
0,150 150,450 450,540 540,750 750,990
be down a little bit

271
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,800
0,210 210,240 240,540 540,690 690,780
got a little bit of

272
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,030
0,150 150,510 510,570 570,960 960,1230
air space in between there.|

273
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,290
0,360 360,540 540,690 690,810 810,1230
Now let's put our first

274
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,240
0,600 870,1080 1080,1170 1170,1590 1590,1950
finger on the first fret.|

275
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,530
0,510 600,1080 1080,1140 1140,1260 1260,1410
Okay, where do we put

276
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,880
0,120 120,450 450,870
our finger well.|

277
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,480
0,570 570,930 930,1380 1380,1530 1530,2130
Anywhere between here and here

278
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,160
0,240 240,540 540,1020
is fair game.|

279
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,860
0,450 480,780 780,1110 1110,1470
But having said that.|

280
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,280
0,570 600,960 960,1590 1590,1650 1650,2190
Right up behind the thread.|

281
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,190
0,210 210,330 330,870 870,1170 1170,1290
Is the easiest place to

282
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,210
0,300 300,390 390,660 660,870 870,1020
press it down with and

283
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,080
0,120 120,300 300,570
you get them.|

284
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,020
0,450 450,750 750,960 960,1080 1080,1440
Best sound from it, not

285
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,520
0,270 270,330 330,780 1230,1260 1320,1500
on the thread a lot

286
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,600
0,60 60,330 330,660 690,870 870,1080
of folks think you might

287
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
0,180 180,270 270,540 540,750 750,840
put your finger on the

288
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,240
0,360 510,1260 1260,1350 1350,1560 1560,1800
fret, not at all that

289
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,950
0,180 180,390 390,690 1110,1320 1320,1710
gets this kind of funky

290
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,090
0,360 360,690 690,810 810,990 990,1140
muted sound is not quite

291
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,500
0,150 150,270 270,510 510,810 1080,1410
what you're going for you

292
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,250
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,570 570,750
want to be hugging up

293
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,110
0,270 270,660 660,900 900,1260 1530,1860
right behind that fret, okay

294
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,220
0,360 390,570 570,660 660,750 750,1110
ready we're on the first

295
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,040
0,540
string.|

296
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,170
0,210 210,330 330,840 840,1380 1680,1830
With our first finger, we're

297
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,340
0,150 150,450 450,660 660,1020 1050,1170
gonna pick over here we're

298
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,960
0,570 570,720 720,1200
embracing our hand.|

299
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,340
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,570 570,960
And we do this first

300
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,230
0,390 420,570 570,1110 1470,1680 1680,1890
ring you ready, let's play

301
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,560
0,90 90,690
it together.|

302
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
0,180 180,270 270,810
Do it again.|

303
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,520
0,240 240,540 540,750 750,1290
And one more time.|

304
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,060
0,240 240,360 360,480 480,810 810,1230
That's with our first finger,

305
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,950
0,300 300,480 480,870 870,1380 1530,1710
now your first finger is

306
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,330
0,150 150,390 420,810 810,1230 1230,1380
going to cover anything that

307
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,410
0,420 420,630 630,900 900,990 990,1080
happens on any of the

308
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,380
0,720
strings.|

309
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,360
0,240 240,450 450,810 810,1260
In this first fret.|

310
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,760
0,240 240,750 750,1350
Your second finger.|

311
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,460
0,180 180,300 300,390 390,690 690,1140
Is going to cover anything

312
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,990
0,150 150,750 960,1200 1200,1470 1470,1530
that happens on any of

313
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,610
0,90 90,720 840,1080 1080,1170 1170,1620
the strings on the second

314
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,340
0,330
fret.|

315
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,480
0,210 210,420 420,810 810,1260 1620,1830
Let's try second finger so

316
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,070
0,150 150,630 630,720 720,1050 1050,1590
we released the first finger

317
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,510
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,780 780,1050
and put our second finger

318
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,380
0,270 270,600
down here.|

319
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,360
0,240 240,420 420,600 600,840 840,960
Okay, now let's try the

320
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,220
0,570 990,1140 1140,1230 1230,1500 1500,1860
third so we put third

321
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,920
0,300 300,570 570,690 690,1350
down nice and strong.|

322
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,180
0,390 390,540 540,840 840,1230
Release the others up.|

323
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,910
0,420 420,660 660,750 750,870 870,990
Now some of you may

324
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,270
0,120 120,450 450,2670 2670,3150 3150,3360
be getting a buzzing sort

325
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:18,990
0,60 60,120 120,480 480,660 660,720
of a sound kind of

326
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,630
0,120 120,510 1800,1950 1950,2100 2100,2640
like this, if your fingers

327
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,670
0,270 270,750 750,1260 1530,1680 1680,2040
aren't strong enough to get

328
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,410
0,240 240,810 810,900 900,1170 1260,1740
good contact with that string

329
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,670
0,120 120,450 450,720 720,1020 1050,1260
to that Fred board you

330
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,300
0,150 150,300 300,420 420,540 540,630
kind of end up with

331
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,090
0,180 180,510 510,810 2370,2580 2580,2790
this buzzy sound, all that's

332
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,870
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,600 600,780
telling you is you're not

333
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,490
0,210 210,540 690,900 900,1110 1110,1620
making a good enough contact

334
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,200
0,300 330,630 630,810 810,990 990,1320
to make sure that fingers

335
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
0,180 180,390 390,600 600,960 960,1200
hung up right close back

336
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,990
0,270 270,450 450,870 1140,1470 1470,1590
behind that threat that's the

337
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,010
0,420 420,660 660,750 750,930 930,1020
easiest place to put it

338
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,560
0,420
down.|

339
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,240
0,240 240,690 900,1080 1080,1230 1230,1410
And there you wanna make

340
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,020
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,480 480,780
sure you get a nice

341
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,480
0,240 240,570 570,1050
good clear sound.|

342
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,880
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,600 600,1140
Okay, now let's do pinky

343
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,540
0,270 270,330 330,450 450,510 510,630
{pinky's -} going to be

344
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,560
0,90 90,600 600,720 720,960 960,1020
the weakest of all of

345
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,210
0,150 150,690 900,1200 1200,1500 1500,1650
your fingers, so you're gonna

346
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,050
0,300 300,420 420,540 540,690 690,840
really have to put him

347
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,280
0,240 240,810
down strong.|

348
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,500
0,360 360,570 570,630 630,1110
Let's try the pinky.|

349
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,440
0,480 480,840 990,1200 1200,1320 1320,1380
Very good, you want to

350
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,400
0,150 150,360 360,510 510,630 630,960
make sure that your hand

351
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,900
0,120 120,630 630,990 990,1230 1230,1500
is not way up here

352
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,000
0,240 240,600 900,1290 1290,1560 1560,2100
like this all off centered

353
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,900
0,210 210,300 300,630 630,810 810,870
with your fingers kind of

354
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,190
0,240 240,360 360,570 570,870 990,1290
aimed up this way you

355
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,200
0,150 150,390 390,750 750,1230 1620,2010
want that wrist down open

356
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,580
0,180 180,450 450,1080
up those fingers.|

357
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,150
0,240 240,480 480,600 600,690 690,870
I bring it out like

358
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,260
0,180 180,300 300,570 570,960 960,1110
that where each finger is

359
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,440
0,360 360,450 450,840
covering a threat.|

360
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,950
0,150 150,300 300,360 360,720 720,810
A lot of players will

361
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,880
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,660 660,930
come at it like this,

362
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,780
0,90 90,360 390,600 600,720 720,900
and then when they have

363
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,800
0,90 90,390 390,750 750,840 840,1020
to use something in that

364
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,940
0,210 210,270 270,510 510,810 900,1140
third or fourth fret, they

365
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,600
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,510 510,660
have to open up their

366
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,550
0,600 810,1080 1080,1230 1230,1650 1740,1950
fingers, now your hand may

367
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,320
0,210 210,360 360,690 690,930 1230,1770
not be used to staying

368
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,400
0,150 150,210 210,600 600,780 780,1080
out in apart like that.|

369
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,440
0,240 240,840 840,990 990,1320 1320,1560
And unfortunately with guitar playing

370
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,160
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,570 570,720
you're gonna be doing this

371
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,660
0,420 420,510 510,810 810,1110 1230,1500
position an awful lot so

372
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,650
0,510 510,570 570,660 660,840 840,990
eventually it will get more

373
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,670
0,90 90,240 240,690 690,810 810,1020
and more comfortable to you,

374
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,120
0,240 240,390 390,600 600,900
it may even be.|

375
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,680
0,180 180,300 300,690 690,1260 1260,1350
You know physically impossible for

376
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,460
0,90 90,150 150,330 330,450 450,780
you to move your fingers

377
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,320
0,210 210,540 540,720 720,1050 1500,1860
very apart right now your

378
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,930
0,720 810,1230 1230,1710 1710,2040 2430,2610
fingers will limber up as

379
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,680
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,570 570,750
you do it just like

380
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,730
0,90 90,210 210,330 330,450 450,1050
if you would be stretching

381
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,370
0,270 270,480 480,930 930,1830 1950,2160
and doing stretching exercises, they

382
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,870
0,210 210,570 570,660 660,900 900,1500
get more and more flexible,

383
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,620
0,90 90,300 300,450 450,540 540,750
the more that you do

384
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,140
0,120
it.|

385
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,730
0,330 330,510 510,630 630,810 810,960
Let's try this one more

386
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,020
0,450 660,900 900,1080 1080,1200 1200,1290
time, we're gonna be on

387
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,210
0,180 180,540 540,1080 1260,1800 1800,2190
that first string first fret.|

388
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,800
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,720 720,900
Here we go, let's play

389
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,300
0,270 270,750
this note.|

390
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,060
0,570 570,1110 1200,1740 1740,2130 2550,3240
Second finger, second fret, you

391
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,470
0,210 210,270 270,420 420,630 630,960
want to make sure using

392
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,510
0,120 120,1110 1200,1530 1530,1590 1590,2040
your fingertips not the flat

393
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,470
0,60 60,210 210,570 570,750 750,960
of your fingers like that

394
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,890
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,360 360,420
you don't want to be

395
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,980
0,210 210,540
doing this.|

396
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,370
0,240 240,540 540,690 690,870 870,960
That works real good on

397
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,630
0,90 90,390 390,660 660,780 780,1260
the first string but unfortunately

398
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,440
0,210 210,390 390,570 570,720 720,810
doesn't work very good on

399
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,670
0,90 90,270 270,750 900,1170 1170,1230
the other strings so you

400
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,540
0,150 150,270 270,330 330,450 450,870
always want to make sure

401
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,700
0,240 240,420 420,840 840,1050 1320,1710
that your fingers are using

402
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,990
0,90 90,570 840,1020 1020,1110 1110,1290
the tips so we did

403
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,100
0,360 360,450 450,600 600,960 960,1110
first we did second here

404
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,300
0,270 270,870
comes third.|

405
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,840
0,150 150,330 330,450 450,630 630,1320
And now we do fourth.|

406
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,630
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,720 720,870
Let's do that one more

407
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,740
0,570
time.|

408
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,560
0,750
First.|

409
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,140
0,990 2130,3570
Second, third.|

410
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,590
0,930 1440,2070 2610,2910 2910,3060 3060,3210
Fourth, now what should your

411
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,820
0,270 270,420 420,660 660,930 930,1230
thumb be doing back here,

412
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,380
0,420 480,750 750,930 930,1110 1110,1410
well I don't really care

413
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,430
0,330 330,450 450,690 690,810 810,1050
what your thumb is doing

414
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,960
0,210 210,540 780,1050 1050,1200 1200,1530
back there, the only problem

415
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,920
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,570 570,960
is your thumb is attached

416
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,060
0,60 60,210 210,660 870,1080 1080,1140
to your wrist and I

417
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,140
0,240 240,510 510,750 750,930 930,1080
do care about where your

418
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,250
0,270 270,390 390,600 810,990 990,1110
wrist is at if your

419
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,750
0,240 240,420 420,600 600,1110 1320,1500
wrist gets too high, you

420
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,770
0,90 90,270 270,630 630,720 720,1020
end up using the wrong

421
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,240
0,210 210,270 270,840 930,1260 1260,1470
kind of muscles and it

422
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,200
0,240 240,450 450,660 660,840 840,960
doesn't work very well for

423
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,490
0,270 270,780 1050,1110 1110,1230 1230,1290
playing guitar you want to

424
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,270
0,90 90,240 240,420 420,660 660,780
make sure that risk is

425
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,470
0,510 720,870 870,990 990,1050 1050,1200
low you want to use

426
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,790
0,120 120,600 600,870 870,1200 1200,1320
your fine motor skills, your

427
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,050
0,210 210,570 570,630 630,750 750,1260
little muscles in your fingers.|

428
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,040
0,150 150,390 390,570 570,930 1140,1470
And bring that down and

429
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,090
0,420 570,720 720,810 810,960 960,1050
so you don't want your

430
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,050
0,240 240,420 420,540 540,690 690,960
thumb way up here like

431
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,340
0,360 480,690 690,870 870,960 960,1290
that, it's not a hook,

432
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,300
0,120 120,330 330,600 600,720 720,960
you're not hanging your hand

433
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,770
0,150 150,330 330,960 1020,1320 1320,1470
on your guitar, you're gonna

434
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,550
0,210 210,300 300,570 570,600 600,780
bring it back a little

435
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,810
0,210 450,690 690,810 810,990 990,1260
bit seem to like that.|

436
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,920
0,240 240,420 420,570 570,750 750,1380
Okay, let's talk about tablature

437
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,570
0,630 630,750 750,780 780,1320 1320,1470
tablature is a notations that

438
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,490
0,600 600,1080 1110,1410 1410,1650 1650,1920
guitars use to show which

439
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,160
0,480 480,600 600,930 930,1530 1920,2670
fret and which finger needs

440
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,150
0,60 60,210 210,660 660,870 870,990
to be played at any

441
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,500
0,420 420,780 900,1050 1050,1200 1200,1350
particular time, it's not really

442
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,760
0,330 330,810 810,930 930,1080 1080,1260
music notation, we'll talk about

443
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,900
0,270 270,720 720,780 780,840 840,1140
music notation in a minute,

444
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,270
0,330 330,450 450,780 780,1590 1950,2220
this is called tablature and

445
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,830
0,120 120,420 420,840 840,960 960,1560
it's something strictly for guitarists

446
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,000
0,300 300,510 510,600 600,870 870,1140
to use it, it really

447
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,830
0,390 420,720 720,1320 1320,1530 1530,1830
helps you visualize what fingers

448
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,760
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,600 600,930
you need to place where.|

449
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,090
0,390 390,570 570,660 660,750 750,900
So if you can look

450
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,340
0,60 60,180 180,630 1200,1710 1710,2250
at your books figure one.|

451
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,300
0,270 270,360 360,660 660,750 750,1590
Is a line of tablature

452
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,290
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,480 480,900
and let me just explain

453
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,360
0,150 150,360 360,750 1110,1710 1710,2070
how that is those six

454
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,610
0,450 450,1080 1080,1380 1470,2190 2190,2250
lines represented there correspond to

455
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,870
0,90 90,420 420,960 960,1140 1140,1260
the six strings on your

456
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,640
0,510
instrument.|

457
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,300
0,360 360,510 510,990 990,1440 1560,1800
Going in reverse order, so

458
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,770
0,90 90,480 480,780 780,900 900,1470
the top string is actually

459
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,000
0,240 240,540 540,810 810,930 930,1230
the top line is actually

460
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,410
0,120 120,450 450,840 1200,1350 1350,1410
your first string, then it

461
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,340
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,570 570,930
goes down to the six

462
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,020
0,390
string.|

463
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,060
0,270 270,570 570,1020
In figure two.|

464
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,570
0,300 300,450 450,660 660,840 840,1260
Where they put some numbers

465
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,410
0,180 180,300 330,540 540,720 720,840
on it, and this is

466
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,970
0,180 180,480 480,720 1080,1440 1440,1560
they're telling you what they're

467
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:55,900
0,210 210,270 270,450 450,600 600,930
trying to tell you there

468
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,770
0,240 240,450 450,510 510,720 720,840
is where to put your

469
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,000
0,420 420,660 660,1080 1080,1140 1140,1230
fingers what fret do you

470
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,930
0,150 150,210 210,420 420,510 510,930
need to put your fingers

471
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,480
0,210
on.|

472
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,370
0,450 480,720 720,840 840,1200 1200,1620
Okay, so the first notation

473
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,090
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,540 540,720
there you see a little

474
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,320
0,540 720,960 960,1050 1050,1140 1140,1230
one right up at the

475
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,790
0,420 510,840 840,1140 1140,1290 1290,1470
top that's telling you on

476
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,800
0,210 210,660 660,1230 1620,1800 1800,2010
that first string, they want

477
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,790
0,60 60,150 150,390 390,510 510,990
you to put your first

478
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,720
0,600
finger.|

479
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
0,210 210,480 480,750 750,1080
And play that note.|

480
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,990
0,420 690,810 810,1170 1170,1320 1320,1620
Okay, the next one after

481
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,330
0,420 720,900 900,990 990,1650 2190,2340
that is a three but

482
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,080
0,120 120,300 300,390 390,480 480,750
it's still on the first

483
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,640
0,450 570,930 930,1260 1260,1470 1470,1560
string so that means you

484
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,260
0,210 210,300 300,660 660,1140 1260,1620
put your third finger still

485
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,670
0,120 120,300 300,570 570,990 1140,1410
on that first string right

486
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,870
0,330 330,540 540,660 660,900 900,1200
after that the next note

487
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,070
0,360 360,780 870,1080 1080,1680 1680,2010
after that it skips down

488
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,090
0,120 120,360 360,480 480,570 570,1020
you'll notice to the second

489
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,920
0,480 720,1140 1140,1260 1260,1560 1560,1830
string, still the third finger

490
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,880
0,180 180,420 420,510 510,720 720,960
though that's what that three

491
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,740
0,120 120,450 450,630
is telling you.|

492
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,840
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,630 630,960
So if I play just

493
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,880
0,270 270,570 570,1170 1680,1830 1830,2040
those three notes it would

494
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,190
0,270 270,450 450,960 1680,2040 2040,2310
be like this first finger

495
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,040
0,450 750,1230
first fret.|

496
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,900
0,660 660,1140 1170,1320 1320,1530 1530,1800
Third finger on that first

497
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,840
0,450
string.|

498
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,830
0,720 720,1140 1140,1290 1290,1470 1470,1830
Third finger on that second

499
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,600
0,360 1080,1260 1260,1530 1530,1620 1620,1770
string you'll notice a little

500
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,740
0,150 150,540 540,810 810,900 900,1140
bit further on in that

501
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,390
0,330 330,510 510,1230 1260,1590 1590,1650
figure to exercise there's a

502
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,580
0,780 930,1410 1410,1770 1770,1890 1890,2190
zero what zero is telling

503
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,240
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,600 600,660
you is they want you

504
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,650
0,90 90,510 600,990 990,1320 1320,1410
to play that string, the

505
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,640
0,420 420,690 690,780 780,840 840,990
second string is the one

506
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,500
0,90 90,240 240,630 990,1590
that it's on open.|

507
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,040
0,210 210,360 360,660 660,1020 1020,1560
So I'm not fretting any

508
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,360
0,420 420,510 510,870 900,1050 1050,1260
threats at all, I'm just

509
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
0,270 270,390 390,780
playing it open.|

510
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,670
0,330 330,690 690,960 960,1170 1170,1320
Now it's pretty easy when

511
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,240
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,510 510,570
you get the hang of

512
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,960
0,150
it.|

513
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,190
0,240 240,420 420,570 570,780 780,870
To read this even though

514
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,090
0,60 60,240 240,270 270,420 420,900
it looks a little confusing

515
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,230
0,210 210,480 630,960 960,1020 1020,1140
right now, after you do

516
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,710
0,60 60,90 90,240 240,360 360,480
it a little bit you

517
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,340
0,150 150,210 210,390 390,540 540,630
kind of see how it

518
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,480
0,390 540,780 780,870 870,990 990,1140
goes, so if I was

519
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,490
0,120 120,480 480,870 870,1320 1830,2010
to play figure two it

520
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,340
0,150 150,510
would be.|

521
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,440
0,420 420,660 660,990 990,1710 1950,2340
Like this first finger first

522
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,740
0,510 810,1680 1680,2280 2340,2790 2790,3300
string, third finger first string.|

523
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,560
0,570 570,1200 1260,1770 1770,2310
Third finger, second string.|

524
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,240
0,630 630,1230 1260,1470 1470,1560 1560,2010
Second finger on the third

525
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,400
0,600
string.|

526
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,620
0,600 600,1260 1440,1920 1920,2370 2550,2790
First finger, second string now

527
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,760
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,750 750,1140
here comes the open strings

528
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,010
0,120 120,420 420,810 810,1260 1260,2250
and open second string and

529
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,820
0,120 120,480 480,930 930,1230
an open first string.|

530
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,390
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,450 450,660
Now, if you look down

531
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,460
0,60 60,390 390,930 1500,1860 1860,2070
to figure three figure three

532
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,810
0,480 480,660 660,720 720,1200 1200,1350
represents how a chord would

533
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,220
0,360 540,840 840,900 900,1080 1080,1410
look all of these numbers

534
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,020
0,360 360,630 630,810 810,1140 1500,1800
stacked upon each other are

535
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,040
0,360 360,510 510,570 570,810 810,1020
telling you to play all

536
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,360
0,150 150,600 600,720 720,810 810,1320
the strings at the same

537
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,160
0,570
time.|

538
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,400
0,210 210,360 360,570 570,810 810,1020
Okay, so let's look on

539
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,390
0,270 270,630 630,750 750,900 900,990
what's happening on each of

540
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,830
0,150 150,630 690,1020 1020,1110 1110,1440
these strings on the first

541
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,210
0,120 120,480 480,930 1020,1200 1200,1380
and second string, you have

542
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,500
0,570 600,780 780,900 900,1080 1080,1290
zeros so that means those

543
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,820
0,60 60,330 330,690
are both open.|

544
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,960
0,210 210,300 300,660 660,1110 1500,1650
On the third string, it

545
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,010
0,210 210,300 300,570 570,840 870,1050
has a one there that

546
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,910
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,600 600,900
means you put your first

547
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,260
0,240 240,510 510,720 720,930 930,1350
finger down on that first

548
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,220
0,390
fret.|

549
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,920
0,180 180,270 270,630 630,900 900,990
On the fourth string and

550
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,780
0,60 60,360 360,810 1500,1770 1770,1860
the fifth string, there are

551
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,100
0,450 450,630 630,900 900,1140 1140,1320
two 's, which means that

552
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,470
0,240 240,330 330,1020 1650,2190 2310,2370
both the second on the

553
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,460
0,330 330,570 570,690 690,930 930,990
second fret on both of

554
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,720
0,180 180,630 630,750 750,960 960,1260
those strings are being played

555
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,500
0,150 150,240 240,570 570,690 690,780
and the last one at

556
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,180
0,90 90,480 750,1080 1080,1560 1560,1680
the bottom is zero so

557
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,080
0,120 120,300 300,510 510,780 780,900
that means that's open as

558
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,160
0,360 480,690 690,780 780,870 870,1080
well so if I play

559
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,860
0,360 360,450 450,660 660,1410
all of those together.|

560
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,860
0,1320
Wow.|

561
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,910
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,540 540,630
Comes out to be a

562
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,320
0,390 600,870 870,1170 1170,1260 1260,1410
chord, any chord but you'll

563
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,840
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,750
learn about that later.|

564
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,220
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,900 900,1020
But that's how accord would

565
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,570
0,150 150,270 270,870 1080,1290 1290,1350
look in tablature, now we're

566
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,140
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,450 450,570
going to talk about some

567
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,020
0,390 390,1230 1830,2070 2070,2610 2640,2880
finger exercises let's review on

568
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,640
0,90 90,360 360,810 1110,1350 1350,1620
our right hand we used

569
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,080
0,90 90,480 480,630 630,930 1200,1440
our pic and we're going

570
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,910
0,60 60,390 390,600 600,1380 1380,1830
to start doing a picking

571
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,590
0,390 390,720 990,1470 1500,1650 1650,1680
pattern now okay, so I

572
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,370
0,210 210,330 330,540 540,600 600,780
want you just on that

573
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,600

first ring I want you

574
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,770

to go a down stroke

575
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,880
0,90 90,210 210,600
with your pick.|

576
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,050
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,450 450,510
And then I want you

577
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,860

579
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,610
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,480 480,810
Then, let's do it down

580
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,860
0,510
again.|

581
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,830
0,210 240,480 480,990 1020,2910 2910,3090
And up again let's try

584
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,370
0,60 60,150 150,420 420,510 510,600
Are you ready on the

585
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,400
0,270 270,750
first string.|

586
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,690
0,270 270,690 1050,2580 2640,3300 3750,5070
Let's go down up down.|

587
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,660
0,690 990,1320 1320,1650 2010,2130 2130,2280
A very good and that's

588
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,500
0,180 180,450 450,600 600,780 780,840
the first thing what's the

589
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,400
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,540 540,900
name of that first string

590
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,590
0,330 330,690 840,1050 1050,1500 1500,1950
remember that that sorry string,

591
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,240
0,240 240,360 360,570 570,780 780,840
let's do it now we're

592
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,720
0,120 120,180 180,240 240,330 330,480
going to do it on

593
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,950
0,120 120,420 420,720 720,810 810,1230
the b string, the second

594
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,960
0,390 690,990 990,1890 1890,1950 1950,2010
string we're going to do

595
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
0,60 60,390 390,690
the same thing.|

596
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,580
0,120 120,210 210,630
Are you ready.|

597
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,380
0,1380 1500,2160
Down up.|

598
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,980
0,1260
Down.|

599
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,010
0,450 450,600 600,1080 1080,1200 1200,1800
Remember be bracing your pinky

600
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,940
0,240 240,330 330,750 750,1140
on your sound board.|

601
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,560
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,840 840,1320
Let's try the third string.|

602
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,780
0,240 240,840
The gene.|

603
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,940
0,180 180,300 300,720 960,2310 2340,2880
Here we go down up

604
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,580
0,1230
down.|

605
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,910
0,780 1080,1320 1320,1500 1500,1650 1650,1740
You wanna go for a

606
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,740
0,540 690,1500 1500,2070
good steady rhythm.|

607
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,990
0,180 180,300 300,720 720,870 870,960
Go as slow as you

608
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,460
0,180 180,270 270,720 990,1290 1290,1470
need to go to get

609
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,870
0,90 90,330 330,750 750,870 870,1410
a good steady, the idea

610
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,960
0,270 270,1260 1470,2010 2010,2610 2880,3060
is control, not speed, if

611
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,370
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,690 720,1410
I can get you control,

612
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,480
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,540 540,1110
then we can get faster

613
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,010
0,180 180,450 450,630 630,750 750,1020
but don't try and be

614
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,060
0,510
a.|

615
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,660
0,510 510,720 720,960 960,1140 1140,1260

0,180 180,660 660,780 780,1380 1410,1560
little tricky at first to

666
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,170
0,390 600,990 990,1260 1260,1380 1380,1500
do, everybody thinks they know

667
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,190
0,120 120,210 210,540 540,660 660,1020
how to control their fingers

668
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,450
0,240 240,330 330,570 570,780 780,1260
until you start playing guitar,

669
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,770
0,360 360,450 450,870 870,1020 1020,1110
then you realize that you

670
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,670
0,150 150,300 300,510 510,780 780,900
don't know your brain really

671
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,630
0,270 270,420 420,570 570,900 900,960

672
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,550
0,420 600,1470 1470,1560 1560,1650 1650,1920
move independently of the others

0,240 240,630 810,1500 1500,1620 1620,1740
very often, so we have

674
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,070
0,90 90,270 270,330 330,690 690,780
to kind of train our

00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,710
0,180 180,390 390,480 480,810 810,1080
aren't used to doing that.|

717
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,440
0,240 240,450 450,780 780,870 870,1680
Make sure using your fingertips

718
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,460
0,870 900,1110 1110,1890 2040,2610 3060,3810
and your finger, the flesh

719
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,840
0,210 210,330 330,840 840,1080 1080,1380
running your fingertips will tough

720
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,370
0,360 690,990 990,1170 1170,1470 1470,1530
enough at this stage of

721
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,020
0,60 60,420 420,720 720,870 870,1650
the game when you're practicing

722
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,420
0,690 690,1050 1050,1320 1320,1470 1470,1860
just play until your fingers

723
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,920
0,270 270,750 810,1110 1110,1230 1230,1500
start hurting once they start

724
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,000
0,300 300,510 510,750 750,930 930,1080
hurting just back off from

725
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,630
0,120 120,240 240,270 270,480 480,630
it for a while, there's

726
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,830
0,120 120,630 630,720 720,1050 1050,1200
no advantage to playing through

727
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,790
0,90 90,480 480,540 540,810 810,960
the pain or anything like

728
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,470
0,210 420,990 990,1260 1260,1500 1500,1680
that just just back off

729
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,490
0,150 150,300 300,450 450,810 810,1020
from it come back on

730
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,540
0,150 180,450 450,720 720,960 960,1050
a few hours later a

731
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,200
0,150 150,240 240,480 480,570 570,630
little bit later on the

732
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,760
0,270
night.|

733
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,520
0,300 300,420 420,690 690,750 750,1170
Give your fingers a chance

734
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,630
0,240 240,540 540,690 690,750 750,960
to heal up a little

735
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,100
0,240 690,900 900,1260 1260,1440 1440,1470
bit and toughen up a

736
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,120
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,810 810,1020
little bit you'll find within

737
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,230
0,240 240,300 300,660 690,1020 1020,1110
about a week they'll be

738
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,090
0,510 630,1170 1200,1710 1710,1800 1800,1860
nice and strong to be

739
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,660
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,510 510,570
able to do what you

740
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,710
0,150 150,210 210,510 540,960 960,1050

742
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,560
0,300 300,540 540,600 600,870 870,1230
now instead of going down

743
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,150

0,180 180,420 420,510 510,840 840,1260
so instead of four beats

746
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,080
0,240 240,540 540,600 600,840 840,930

0,60 60,630 630,720 720,990 990,1140

00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,620
0,270
one.|

765
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,020

one more time, this will

770
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,690
0,120 120,240 240,810 1020,1500 1500,1920

0,60 60,270 270,540 540,870 870,1200
of just doing two beads,

781
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,1050 1050,1680
we were doing for initially

782
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,460
0,180 180,270 270,330 330,540 540,990
then we are doing to

783
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,270

0,570 570,660 660,750 750,900 900,1110
Brace now, we're just doing

788
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,800
0,270 270,600 600,690 690,840 840,1140
down strokes on all these

789
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,810
0,240 240,510 510,660 660,1230 1260,1980
so just be down down

790

fourth finger back to third

794
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,800
0,870
second.|

795
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,490
0,180 180,840 1800,1920 1920,2070 2070,2280
And first, you should really

796
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,750
0,120 120,360 360,420 420,600 600,1260
do each of these exercises

797
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,280
0,210 210,420 420,510 510,1080 1320,1530
on all the strings, it'll

798
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,880
0,210 210,240 240,420 420,540 540,600
take a little bit of

799
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,320
0,450 540,810 810,900 900,1140 1140,1440
time and it's pretty tricky

800
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,610
0,120 120,570 690,960 960,1170 1170,1290
at first but as you

801
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,510
0,120 120,210 210,450 450,540 540,900
do it more and more

802
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,010
0,210 210,540 540,660 660,870 870,1470
your fingers will get better

803
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,250
0,510 510,1050 1200,2250 2280,2670 2670,3090
very quickly in being accurate

804
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,880
0,120 120,300 300,360 360,540 540,630
on where they need to

805
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,410
0,330 390,570 570,690 690,990 990,1530
go it may seem difficult

806
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,910
0,150 150,210 210,450 480,1260 1260,1500
and a little hesitancy right

807
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,140
0,390 540,930 930,1050 1050,1140 1140,1230
now, um, you may be

808
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,010

0,540 600,1170 1170,1290 1290,1500 1500,1710
finger and it just takes

810
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,440
0,90 90,120 120,420 420,660 660,720
you a second before you

811
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,400
0,90 90,390 390,540 540,720 720,960
can actually move that third

812
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,840
0,390 450,840 840,1020 1020,1230 1230,1440
finger that's what that's what

813
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,610
0,240 240,870 870,960 960,1350 1590,1770

0,180 180,360 360,450 450,750 750,1020
not meant to be great

815
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,070
0,270 270,330 330,510 510,840 1020,1440
music at this point before

0,60 60,360 360,930 960,1230 1230,1320
the chord diagram as you

909
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,440
0,120 120,1050 1290,1470 1470,1830 1830,1950

0,630 660,870 870,1230 1230,1830 1890,2100
Now the different lines and

917
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,000
0,270 270,750 750,990 990,1350 1350,1650
different circles mean different things,

918
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,870
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,450 450,870

0,180 180,330 330,480 480,720 720,810
On them, you'll notice on

923
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,600

but it's going to be

929
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,490
0,360 360,450 450,570 570,690 690,750
open you're not going to

do that the numbers will

957
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,240
0,210 210,510 510,690 690,960 1080,1740

not to play that string

978
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,280
0,300 300,690 690,780 780,1080 1080,1350

0,210 210,330 330,570 570,690 690,870
string as well, they just

1015
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,960
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,540 540,660
give you the ones that

1016
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,680
0,150 150,360 360,570 570,630 630,720
you're actually supposed to be

1017
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,420
0,390
playing.|

1018
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,330
0,330 330,540 540,720 720,990 990,1470
Let's try that c chord

1019
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,160
0,300 300,450 450,870 900,1380 1380,1470
one more time starting at

1020
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,750
0,210 210,570 570,1080 1200,1470 1470,1590
that fifth string, we're gonna

1021
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,780
0,180 180,420 420,600
go through it.|

1022
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,540
0,300 300,1050
Each string.|

1023
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,810
0,270 270,540 540,630 630,660 660,1080
One string at a time.|

1024
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,380
0,300 300,600 600,690 690,780 780,990
Ready starting on the fifth

1025
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,160
0,450
string.|

1026
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,580
0,1710 1740,2790 3420,3930 3930,4620
Third finger second finger.|

1027
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,520
0,660
Open.|

1028
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,660
0,480 480,990 1320,1470 1470,1860
First finger and open.|

1029
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,760
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,390 390,570
Now we're going to play

1030
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,350
0,270 270,330 330,450 450,1020 1350,1590
all of them together ready

1031
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,980
0,60 60,150 150,360 360,510 510,630
to get back up to

1032
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,780
0,540
fifth.|

1033
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,830
0,300 300,780 780,1200 1230,1620 1620,1680
Fifth string let loose we're

1034
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,060
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,600 600,1230
gonna play them all together

1035
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,800
0,660 720,1290
ready go.|

1036
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,820
0,240 240,330 330,870
One more time.|

1037
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,140
0,60
Yeah.|

1038
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,480
0,390 450,870 870,960 960,1230 1230,1380
Now, sometimes your chord may

1039
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,260
0,390 390,510 510,600 600,690 690,780
sound if you don't have

1040
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:16,920
0,120 120,390 390,450 450,510 510,660
your fingers in the right

1041
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,630
0,360 1080,1290 1290,1440 1440,1500 1500,1710
spot you kind of get

1042
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,040
0,120 120,390 390,600 600,720 720,870
a couple notes that aren't

1043
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,050
0,420 420,1620 1620,1830 1830,1890 1890,2010
sounding particularly right or they're

1044
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,430
0,360 360,450 450,780 1020,1140 1140,1380
buzzing in some in some

1045
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,410
0,480 630,1140 1140,1260 1260,1500 1500,1980
respect, check your hand position,

1046
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,390
0,330 330,510 510,600 600,840 840,1410
well this is that see

1047
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,140
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,570 570,660
that I was trying to

1048
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,610
0,450 570,810 810,960 960,1200 1200,1470
play on that fifth string

1049
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,720
0,90 90,240 240,420 420,720 720,1110
and it's too far back,

1050
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,890
0,180 180,330 330,390 390,690 690,930
I've got to move that

1051
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,640
0,540
finger.|

1052
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,090
0,180 180,300 300,570 570,810 810,930
Where it's just hugging up

1053
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,830
0,300 300,510 510,870 1230,1620 1620,1740
behind that fret and then

1054
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,670
0,90 90,330 330,480 480,720 720,840
he comes out nice and

1055
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,600
0,810
clear.|

1056
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,420
0,360 690,870 870,990 990,1200 1200,1470
Now, if you don't have

1057
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
0,450 450,780 780,1170 1170,1290 1290,1440
good hand strength and that's

1058
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,940
0,120 120,210 210,540 540,720 720,900
what we're building up right

1059
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,290
0,270 570,750 750,960 960,1200 1200,1350
now, it may kind of

1060
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,550
0,210 210,300 300,390 390,510 510,600
even though you have your

1061
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,570
0,240 240,510 510,810 810,900 900,1020
finger right spot, it may

1062
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,230
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,600 600,660
come out as kind of

1063
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,370
0,60 60,390 390,570 570,780 780,1140
a dead note like that

1064
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,840
0,120 120,300 300,630 630,1230 2040,2730
the only difference between this

1065
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,340
0,210 210,690
and this.|

1066
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,390
0,180 180,420 420,570 570,990 990,1380
Is putting my fingers down

1067
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,890
0,150 150,300 300,450 450,1020 1020,1290
a little bit stronger, if

1068
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,970
0,90 90,480 510,750 750,960 960,1080
you notice I didn't move

1069
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,740
0,120 120,480 480,570 570,930 1530,1770
my fingers at all it's

1070
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,410
0,540 540,1740 1740,2190 2190,2310 2310,2670
basically how hard I'm pressing

1071
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,180
0,150 150,840 1260,1410 1410,1530 1530,1770
him down, if you press

1072
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,620
0,90 90,330 330,540 540,870 1020,1440
him down hard enough eventually

1073
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,430
0,120 120,360 360,450 450,690 690,810
that court will open up

1074
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,020
0,90 90,480 480,750 750,1530 1530,1590
and blossom up {zat's -}

1075
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,140
0,60 60,390 390,780
A C chord.|

1076
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,710
0,300 300,390 390,720 720,900 900,960
Now the second chord, we're

1077
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,670
0,120 120,180 180,480 720,870 870,960
going to learn is A

1078
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,500
0,300 300,780 780,1140 1410,1740 1740,1830
G seventh chord c is

1079
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,730
0,450 450,510 510,750 750,1020 1020,1230
probably the most common chord

1080
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,440
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,840 930,1710
you're ever gonna find G7

1081
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,460
0,120 120,360 360,420 420,720 720,1020
is probably the next common

1082
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,510
0,240 240,510 510,720 720,870 870,1050
most common chord you're going

1083
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,240
0,60 60,420
to play.|

1084
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,320
0,840 960,1380 1380,1560 1560,1740 1740,1860
Here, let's go through a

1085
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,300
0,330 330,480 480,960 1410,1650 1650,1950
string by string that first

1086
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,680
0,480 570,690 690,870 870,990 990,1380
string I've got my first

1087
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,580
0,570
finger.|

1088
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,200
0,240 240,450 450,780 780,1260 1740,2010
On that first fret, then

1089
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,930
0,90 90,750 780,1410 1650,2250 2250,2730
the second string, third string

1090
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,370
0,270 270,360 360,690 690,1080 1140,1320
and the fourth string are

1092
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,780
0,150 150,390 390,1260
Well that's easy.|

1093
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,860
0,300 300,450 450,540 540,840 840,1320
Now on the fifth string,

1094
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,360
0,150 150,330 330,420 420,810 810,1350
I've got my second finger

1095
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,520
0,990 990,1080 1080,1170 1170,1650 1650,1890
and on the sixth string

1096
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,200
0,120 120,570 570,1020 1200,1500 1500,1680
the lowest string that e

1097
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,970
0,360 360,900 1320,1500 1500,1680 1680,1770

0,1590 1590,1770 1770,1860 1860,2040 2040,2610
Let's play them all together.|

1100
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,480
0,300 300,1020
Now altogether.|

1101
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,320
0,270 270,540 900,1320 1470,1620 1620,1740
Very good, okay if you

1102
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,090
0,180 180,330 630,1230 1230,1410 1410,1770
look at exercise number one

1103
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,260
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,480 480,990
if you look at exercise

1104
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,220
0,210 210,510
number one.|

1105
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,280
0,210 210,480 480,930 990,1230 1230,1680
It goes through the c

1106
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,480
0,150 150,210 210,450 450,840 840,1200
and the g seventh chord

1107
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,400
0,660 660,990 990,1050 1050,1380 1590,1860
alternating between the two so

1108
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,020
0,210 210,450 450,570 570,840 960,1620
let's start with that, here's

1109
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,430
0,120 120,360 360,810 1080,1350 1350,1410
the c chord, take a

1110
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,420
0,540
second.|

1111
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,800
0,210 210,360 360,420 420,540 540,900
Get all of your fingers

1112
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,140
0,60 60,150 150,390 390,1020
in the right spots.|

1113
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,050
0,180 180,450 450,1020 1020,1230 1230,1410
And that diamond right there

1114
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,890
0,90 90,330 330,600 600,690 690,840
is just telling you that

you play that c chord

1116
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,620
0,90 90,330 330,630 630,840 1440,1740
and just hold it until

1117
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,400
0,120 120,360 360,450 450,510 510,780
it's time for the next

1118
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,570
0,450 450,630 630,870 870,1020 1020,1170
G7, so let's play that

1119
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,980
0,210 210,510 510,1020
c chord first.|

1120
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,260
0,750
Ready.|

1121
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,900
0,690
GO.|

1122
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,250
0,300 300,480 480,810 810,990 990,1050
Now let's switch over to

1123
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,380
0,210 210,990 1590,1740 1740,1890 1890,2130
that G7 I can move

1124
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,670
0,180 180,570 570,660 660,990 990,1290
my third and second finger

1125
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,380
0,270 270,510 510,570 570,1080 1500,1710
just up a string, and

1126
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,280
0,30 30,210 210,330 330,630 630,900
I move my first finger

1127
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,660
0,240 240,300 300,750 1050,1260 1260,1380
down a string and I'm

1128
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,400
0,480
there.|

1129
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,020
0,750
MHM.|

1130
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,020
0,240 240,330 330,480 480,720 720,810
Now I go back to

1131
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,640
0,120 120,390 390,840 1290,1350 1350,1620
the c chord I move

1132
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,200
0,270 270,570 570,720 720,1110 1110,1560
those back into place there,

1133
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,400
0,240 240,420 420,690 690,810 810,930
this one up and I'm

1134
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,220
0,90 90,180 180,450 450,960
at A C chord.|

1135
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,510
0,360 360,480 480,600 600,870 870,1530
Back to the g seventh.|

1136
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,000
0,780
MHM.|

1137
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,290
0,180 180,360 360,510 510,630 630,870
And now to the sea

1138
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,120
0,450
corn.|

1139
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,540
0,720
MHM.|

1140
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,070
0,90 90,300 300,510 510,660 660,810
We better try that one

1141
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,680
0,180 180,360 360,780 1200,2070 2100,2610
one more time somehow getting

1142
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,300
0,150 150,330 330,810 810,1350 1410,1620
all those chords and the

1143
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,830
0,570 570,1080 1080,1200 1200,1350 1350,1530
fingers together and all that

1144
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,460
0,240 240,300 300,450 450,570 570,630
takes a little bit of

1145
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,540
0,270 270,360 360,660 930,990 990,1080
time and effort to do

1146
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,830
0,150 150,240 240,480 480,930 1020,1290
that one more time start

1147
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,100
0,90 90,240 240,450 450,900
on that c chord.|

1148
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,800
0,750
Hello.|

1149
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,560
0,180 180,570 570,840 840,1560
Now switch that G7.|

1150
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,090
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,540 540,630
You may have to do

1151
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,800
0,120 120,420 420,600 600,1170 1560,1710
it finger by finger or

1152
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,280
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,390 390,480
if you can do it

1153
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,510
0,180 180,540 540,750 750,990 990,1230
all together that's even better,

1154
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,560
0,150 150,240 240,330 330,540 540,1050
let's do A G seventh.|

1155
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,040
0,510 510,630 630,750 750,1050 1050,1410
Back to the c chord

1156
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,870
0,330 330,810 810,1050 1050,1350 1350,1830
now five string cord remember

1157
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,220
0,420 420,600 600,750 750,1050 1050,1290
don't play that lowest six

1158
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,940
0,480
string.|

1159
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,190
0,390 390,510 510,1170 1170,1740 1740,1830
Back to G7 all the

1160
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,240
0,420 420,510 510,840 840,930 930,1050
strings are used on the

1161
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,220
0,630
G7.|

1162
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,900
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,630 630,750
And then back to the

1163
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,320
0,510
sea.|

1164
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,140
0,210 210,240 240,390 390,480 480,960
Take a look at exercise

1165
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
0,210 210,540
number two.|

1166
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,240
0,360 360,510 510,810 810,1290 1290,1860
This is called slash notation,

1167
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,930
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,660 660,690
you'll see this quite a

1168
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,950
0,180 180,300 300,330 330,720 720,1020
bit as a guitar player

1169
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,880
0,150 150,450 450,570 570,810 810,930
there's something we play in

1170
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,140
0,240 240,270 270,510 750,960 960,1260
quite a bit, the different

1171
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,490
0,570 570,750 750,960 960,1260 1260,1350
slashes, all that's telling you

1172
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,090
0,60 60,240 240,480 480,540 540,600
at this stage of the

1173
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,530
0,330 480,960 960,1170 1170,1320 1320,1440
game is you're gonna be

1174
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,330
0,480 480,840 840,1350 1380,1560 1560,1800
strumming one strum for each

1175
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,160
0,570 570,810 810,960 960,1290 1560,1830
slash that you see okay,

1176
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,030
0,180 180,360 360,510 510,600 600,870
so let's get our c

1177
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,380
0,270 270,480 480,630 630,1020
chord back up again.|

1178
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,710
0,180 180,390 390,660 690,1290 1290,1530
And let's do exercise number

1179
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,560
0,420
two.|

1180
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,200
0,780
Ready.|

0,1260 1650,2250 2250,2490 2490,2820 2820,3300
Three four the next measure,

1185
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:20,910

one two three four now

1186
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,890
0,330 330,1020 1320,1740 1740,1890 1890,1980
g seventh switch over to

1187
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,260
0,270 270,960
g seventh.|

1188
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:29,980
0,1320 1380,2280 2580,3810 4020,4980 5010,5370
One two three four next

1189
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,940
0,660 840,1950 2040,2880
measure, one two.|

1190
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,300
0,960
Three.|

1191
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,720
0,720
Four.|

1192
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,350
0,150 150,360 360,450 450,690 690,1230
And back to that c

1193
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,700
0,1290 1350,2550 2610,3750 4110,4710
one two three four.|

1194
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,340
0,420 420,780 1380,1680 1680,1920 1920,1950
Very good now take a

1195
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,780
0,150 150,210 210,750 750,960 960,1440
look at exercise number three

1196
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,220
0,330 330,420 420,540 540,1020 1020,1200
now we're gonna alternate those

1197
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,870
0,390 390,570 570,900 900,1110 1110,1650
chords a little bit quicker.|

1198
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,150
0,240 240,360 360,420 420,600 600,720
Which, as I know it's

1199
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,260
0,270 270,420 420,480 480,660 660,1110
probably going a little fast

1200
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,970
0,270 270,510 750,1170 1170,1410 1410,1710
for ya, but let's try

1201
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,560

00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,520
0,330 330,840
Let's go.|

1204
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,280
0,1440 1620,2970 3000,4320
One two three.|

0,810 810,1140 1140,1260 1260,1380 1380,2220
For now to the G7.|

1206
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,270
0,390 390,510 510,810 810,1560 1890,2460
Try and not hesitate between

1207
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,580
0,210 210,810
each chord.|

1208
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,540
0,390 390,510 510,1380
Back to sea.|

0,450 450,570 570,1260
Back to sea.|

1215
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,220
0,780
HMM.|

1216
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,360
0,570
ME.|

1217
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,940
0,540
HMM.|

1218
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,540
0,450 450,720 930,1200 1200,1320 1320,1860
Very good, that's the c

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,860
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,690 690,1140
and that's the g seventh

1220
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,390
0,330 630,990 990,1140 1140,1260 1260,1530
chord now may have moved

1221
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,260
0,60 60,240 240,600 600,750 750,870
a little fast for you

1222
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,280
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,840 840,1020
may have trouble keeping up

1223
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,630
0,90 90,240 240,570 690,1020 1020,1350
at this point, but after

1224
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,710
0,150 150,300 300,480 780,990 990,1080

you'll be able to knock

1228
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,520
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,1020
these out pretty quickly.|

1229
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,870
0,240 240,540 540,630 630,810 810,990
Okay, welcome to get our

tips on this segment, we're

1231
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,900
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,720 810,1440
going to talk about specific

1232
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,620
0,270 270,360 360,510 510,600 600,720
things that have to do

1233
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,940
0,120 120,480 480,840 900,1170 1170,1320
with guitar playing that aren't

1234
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,290
0,540 540,630 630,1050 1050,1260 1260,1350
necessarily the technique stuff that

1235
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:54,980
0,120 120,240 240,480 480,600 600,690
we've been governed in the

1236
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,960
0,180 180,540
other section.|

1237
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,440
0,450 450,510 510,720 720,1050 1050,1200
These are some things these

1238
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,940
0,60 60,270 270,780 870,1260 1260,1500
are some items that I

1239
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,140
0,180 180,660 660,810 810,1020 1020,1200
would suggest you get from

1240
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,340
0,90 90,390 390,870 870,1050 1050,1200
the very beginning if you're

1241
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,420
0,390 390,510 510,780 780,870 870,1080
interested in starting to play

1242
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,440
0,360 390,540 540,630 630,840 840,1020
guitar, you can pick these

1243
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,840
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,930
up on our website.|

1244
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:05,880
0,360 360,450 450,570 570,780 780,990
Or you can also check

1245
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,280
0,120 120,330 330,630 630,1020
your local music store.|

1246
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,370
0,420 420,510 510,570 570,690 690,870
First thing we're gonna talk

1247
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:08,880
0,180 180,240 240,390 390,450 450,510
about is one of the

1248
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,140
0,180 180,810
most useful.|

1249
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,450
0,600 600,810 810,870 870,1290 1290,1620
Things is an electric guitar

1250
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,130
0,510 930,1140 1140,1290 1290,1350 1350,1680
tuner, they come in different

1251
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,180
0,270 270,390 390,870 870,990 990,1050
shapes and sizes, this is

1252
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,160
0,30 30,210 210,690 690,1020 1500,1980
a pretty standard one you

1253
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,600
0,240 240,450 450,540 540,930 930,1170
would plug your guitar into

1254
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,230
0,120 120,330 330,420 420,540 540,630
your guitar would have to

1255
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,260
0,90 90,150 150,660
have a pickup.|

1256
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,720
0,270 270,540 540,600 600,930 930,1230
In either an electric guitar

1257
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,710
0,150 150,210 210,600 600,840 840,990
or an acoustic guitar like

1258
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,400
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,570 570,690
this one that does have

1259
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,080
0,90 90,480 600,750 750,900 1290,1680
a pickup in it and

1260
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,890
0,90 90,330 330,420 420,690 690,810
you plug it in and

1261
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,120
0,90 90,330 330,420 420,720 720,1230
it helps your guitar tune.|

1262
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,270
0,390 720,960 960,1050 1050,1170 1170,1650
And as you can see

1263
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,040
0,240 240,840 1050,1320 1320,1410 1410,1650
the tuning is a little

1264
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,600
0,150 150,270 270,900 900,1200 1200,1560
bit of a tricky subject,

1265
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,170
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,480 480,570
if you try and do

1266
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,700
0,90 90,540 630,930 930,1290 1290,1530
it manually, so electric tuner

1267
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,810
0,180 180,450 480,870 870,960 960,1110
like this, sometimes you don't

1268
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,560
0,150 150,300 300,360 360,570 570,750
even need to pick up,

1269
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,120
0,300 300,450 450,1050 1050,1170 1170,1410
they have microphones in them

1270
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,050
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,690 690,780
and you just play the

1271
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,310
0,360 390,510 510,600 600,840 840,1260
note and it tells you

1272
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,750
0,240 240,300 300,450 450,540 540,870
whether you need to loosen

1273
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,770
0,90 90,450 510,780 780,960 960,1020
the string or whether you

1274
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,670
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,570 570,900
need to tighten the string

1275
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,020
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,660 660,990
and when you get in

1276
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:45,740
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,450 450,690
when you get the dot

1277
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,150
0,60 60,150 150,540 840,1110 1110,1410
in the middle then you've

1278
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,480
0,210 210,300 300,690
you're in tune.|

1279
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,160
0,330 330,510 510,570 570,660 660,1050
Another thing I would suggest

1280
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,850
0,90 90,360 360,540 540,630 630,690
you get right from the

1281
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,080
0,240 240,690
very beginning.|

1282
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,230
0,150 150,240 240,600 600,1140 1620,1650
Is a string winder a

1283
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,670
0,240 240,420 420,630 630,990 1140,1410
little thing like this probably

1284
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,450
0,180 180,450 450,510 510,720 720,780
just cost a buck or

1285
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,490
0,330 750,1140 1140,1440 1440,1590 1590,2040
two a when you're changing

1286
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,680
0,750 870,1200 1200,1350 1350,1410 1410,2190
strings, this is a lifesaver

1287
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,030
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,1140 1140,1320
because you'll be winding and

1288
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,560
0,570 570,810 810,1200 1200,1410 1410,1530
winding these strings all day

1289
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,670
0,450 480,780 780,870 870,1020 1020,1110
long, if you don't have

1290
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,810
0,60 60,390 390,810 870,1050 1050,1140
a stream liner, so it's

1291
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,370
0,330 330,720 900,1260 1260,1470 1470,1560
well worth the buck and

1292
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,180
0,30 30,270 270,390 390,570 570,810
a half to get one

1293
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,800
0,60 60,450
of these.|

1294
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,580
0,540 540,690 690,780 780,900 900,1530
Next thing I would suggest

1295
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,400
0,180 180,270 270,930 1380,1950 2370,2640
is a case, um, some

1296
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,570
0,120 120,240 240,480 480,780 780,1170
of you may have cases

1297
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,380
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,690 690,810
that had come with your

1298
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,760
0,450 570,780 780,930 930,990 990,1380
guitar, a lot of guitars

1299
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,720
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,840 840,960
don't come with cases, they

1300
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,150
0,150 150,270 270,330 330,1440 1440,2430
just come in a box

1301
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,340
0,390 390,990 1530,2010 2010,2070 2070,2190
shipping container so you don't

1302
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,940
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,510 510,600
want to use that as

1303
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,750
0,120 120,390 390,540 540,720 720,810
your case it's good for

1304
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,290
0,60 60,150 150,270 270,450 450,540
you to go ahead and

1305
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,040
0,120 120,150 150,510 510,570 570,750
get a case now there's

1306
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,940
0,180 180,420 420,750 750,810 810,900
three different types, you can

1307
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,680
0,120 120,150 150,750 750,1230 1380,1740
get a hardwood case which

1308
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,700
0,300 300,420 420,780 780,900 900,1020
that's as strong as you

1309
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,420
0,150 150,540
can get.|

1310
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,060
0,330 330,630 810,1170 1170,1230 1230,1410
And that's maybe a little

1311
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,560
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,840 870,1500
bit more than you're you're

1312
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,910
0,330 330,420 420,810 870,1140 1140,1350
wanting to spend they're pretty

1313
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,080
0,390 390,510 510,630 630,810 810,1170
pricey but they do protect

1314
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,580
0,90 90,630 750,1140 1140,1410 1410,1500
your instrument, the best it

1315
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,440
0,120 120,420 840,1200 1230,1770 1770,1860
can be that kind of

1316
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,340
0,270 270,510 510,630 630,810 810,900
step down from that is

1317
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,290
0,240 240,300 300,960 960,1500 1740,1950
called a chipboard case it's

1318
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,610
0,60 60,510 510,930 930,1230 1230,1320
a solid case but it's

1319
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,750
0,360 360,510 510,630 630,750 750,1140
almost made out of a

1320
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,760
0,600 600,660 660,990 990,1470 1470,2010
cardboard a strong cardboard material

1321
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,260
0,300 300,360 360,780 780,990 990,1230
that's a chipboard case, that's

1322
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,060
0,270 270,600 690,1320 1380,1710 1710,1800
good for a plugging your

1323
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,290
0,360 360,780 780,930 930,1020 1020,1230
guitar around getting in and

1324
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:51,980
0,90 90,150 150,210 210,480 480,690
out of the car that

1325
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,680
0,180 180,240 240,510
sort of thing.|

1326
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,460
0,270 270,600 600,810 810,900 900,1470
The third type of cases,

1327
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,990
0,90 90,660 660,1020 1020,1080 1080,1530
a soft case, a padded

1328
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,580
0,450 510,750 750,930 930,1020 1020,1590
case, you put your guitar

1329
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,810
0,390 390,660 660,870 870,930 930,1170
in this kind of zip

1330
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,920
0,60 60,270 270,660 660,990 990,1110
it all up, carried on

1331
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,720
0,90 90,540 840,1350 1350,1650 1650,1800
your back and carry it

1332
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,250
0,60 60,120 120,180 180,600 1110,1530
out of the car, it

1333
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,310
0,480 780,1380 1440,2640 2670,3000 3000,3060
isn't as protective as the

1334
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,720
0,300 300,780 810,1050 1050,1140 1140,1410
hard cases but it does

1335
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,160
0,270 270,450 450,720 720,1260 1260,1440
offer some great advantages in

1336
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,120
0,720
portability.|

1337
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,580
0,480 810,1050 1050,1140 1140,1350 1350,1590
Um, some of the little

1338
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,570
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,570 570,990
things that I would suggest

1339
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,760
0,90 90,480 930,1140 1140,1860
you get a metronome.|

1340
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,640
0,270 270,540 750,960 960,1350 1350,1740
Here's a pretty standard metronome,

1341
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,540
0,90 90,330 330,510 510,600 600,900
they also come in different

1342
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
0,300 300,660
kinds, too.|

1343
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,750
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,870 870,1200
Only thing a metronome does

1344
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,610
0,120 120,420 420,630 630,1260 1260,1860
is click off a tempo

1345
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,200
0,180 180,360 360,690 690,1230 1290,1530
a good steady tempo I

1346
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,520
0,150 150,450 450,540 540,960
can speed it up.|

1347
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,290
0,180 180,420 420,510 510,1050 1350,1650
And slow it down they

1348
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,940
0,150 150,750 750,1200
have electronic ones.|

1349
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,560
0,210 210,720
As well.|

1350
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,570
0,240 240,330 330,630 630,690 690,750
Now I encourage you to

1351
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,380
0,180 180,390 390,510 510,750 750,810
get there's all kinds of

1352
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,760
0,480 480,690 750,1110 1110,1230 1230,1380
{metronome's -} some of them

1353
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,080
0,360 360,510 510,1020 1020,1260 1260,1320
offer a beep where it

1354
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,790
0,360 360,660 660,780 780,1110 1230,1710
just beeps at you, other

1355
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,930
0,300 330,510 510,630 630,690 690,1140
ones you have a click

1356
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,340
0,150 150,240 240,420 420,900 900,1380
and I would definitely recommend

1357
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:48,940
0,120 120,240 240,330 330,510 510,600
you get the ones that

1358
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,440
0,120 120,180 180,690 810,1380 1380,1500
have a click not, that

1359
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,640
0,330 480,630 630,810 810,1050 1050,1200
has a little beep that

1360
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,230
0,240 240,690 900,1230 1230,1320 1320,1590
goes past a it sounds

1361
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,520
0,300 300,630 630,840 840,1140 1140,1290
good when you're listening to

1362
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,150
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,420 420,630
it, but when you actually

1363
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,110
0,240 240,570 570,720 720,870 870,960
start playing with one that

1364
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,670
0,180 180,240 240,510 690,1020 1020,1560
has a beat, you'll realize

1365
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,870
0,240 240,570 570,780 780,840 840,990
it's much better to have

1366
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,560
0,90 90,180 180,330 330,390 390,690
one that has a click.|

1367
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,330
0,600 600,660 660,810 810,1110 1110,1200
Also I would encourage you

1368
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,350
0,60 60,210 210,240 240,600 600,1020
to get a music stand

1369
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,250
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,480 480,690
you can get the little

1370
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,320
0,330 330,780 990,1620 1680,1980 1980,2070
wire ones, um, or you

1371
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,370
0,120 120,450 480,660 660,870 870,1050
can get a little more

1372
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,260
0,600 630,960 960,1230 1230,1620 1620,1890
sturdy metal music stands place

1373
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,800
0,120 120,180 180,240 240,450 450,540
for you to put your

1374
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,050
0,450 540,960 960,1530 1530,2070 2070,2250
music, put your resources that

1375
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:11,890
0,120 120,390 390,570 570,720 720,840
you're going off of so

1376
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,670
0,120 120,300 300,480 480,690 690,780
you're not just sitting on

1377
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,990
0,60 60,510 540,1020 1020,1170 1170,1320
the couch looking at it

1378
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,190
0,210 210,480 480,660 660,870 870,1200
far away at a coffee

1379
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,150
0,270 270,330 330,600 600,750 750,960
table or something like that.|

1380
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,300
0,480 510,750 750,930 930,1140 1140,1230
Now some other things I

1381
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,380
0,120 120,600 600,750 750,900 900,1080
would suggest you have done

1382
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,440
0,120 120,240 240,660
with your guitar.|

1383
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,270
0,330 330,420 420,540 540,600 600,720
Because you want to make

1384
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,620
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,930 1020,1350
sure that your guitar is

1385
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,970
0,420 420,510 510,780 780,960 960,1320
easy to play there's nothing

1386
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,830
0,480 600,870 870,1200 1200,1290 1290,1860
worse than playing a guitar

1387
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,870
0,330 330,480 480,780 780,1620 1650,1800
that is just difficult to

1388
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,760
0,480 540,810 810,1050 1050,1230 1230,1890
play, it gets you frustrated

1389
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,080
0,300 300,390 390,1080 1080,1260 1260,1320
hurt your fingers and you

1390
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,220
0,150 150,390 480,810 810,930 930,1140
end up wanting to Chuck

1391
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,480
0,90 90,300 300,570 900,1140 1140,1260
the whole thing so it's

1392
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,530
0,30 30,450 450,630 630,960 960,1050
a very good idea to

1393
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,080
0,210 210,330 330,900 1710,2430 2430,2550
have your guitar setup is

1394
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,160
0,150 150,270 270,540 540,930 930,1080
what they call it have

1395
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,090
0,60 60,510 510,690 690,810 810,930
a setup done on your

1396
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,860
0,420 630,1050 1050,1350 1380,1590 1590,1770
guitar what they what they

1397
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,700
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,750 750,840
do is they look at

1398
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,950
0,90 90,660 1020,1290 1290,1590 1770,2250
your guitar and they look

1399
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,670
0,90 90,240 240,450 450,600 600,720
and make sure that your

1400
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,810
0,270 270,390 390,690 690,780 780,1140
whether your neck is straight,

1401
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,950
0,240 240,330 330,420 420,480 480,840
you can do a visual

1402
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,940
0,210 210,300 300,570 570,930 930,990
check of that yourself at

1403
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,990
0,330 390,690 690,840 840,990 990,1050
home by just kind of

1404
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,040
0,360 360,690 690,750 750,960 960,1050
looking down the neck of

1405
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,020
0,90 90,720
your guitar.|

1406
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,880
0,180 180,480 480,720 720,900 900,1140
And making sure it's pretty

1407
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,810
0,390 390,480 480,630 630,780 780,930
straight, you don't want it

1408
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,820
0,450 450,960 1050,1380 1380,1710 1710,2010
bowing in or bowing back

1409
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,820
0,210 210,630
out again.|

1410
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,810
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,930 1020,1290
And they can adjust your

1411
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,220
0,480 600,840 840,900 900,1200 1200,1410
guitar through a metal raw

1412
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,210
0,210 210,510 510,840 840,900 900,990
that's actually inside of your

1413
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,530
0,330 330,570 570,840 1020,1140 1140,1320
sound hole here it's called

1414
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,460
0,60 60,450 450,750 750,870 870,930
a truss rod so it

1415
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,510
0,240 240,330 330,750 750,900 900,1050
can be adjusted its not

1416
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,140
0,150 150,300 300,360 360,420 420,630
that big of a deal

1417
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,820
0,90 90,360
at all.|

1418
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,300
0,360 360,540 540,780 780,990 990,1140
The other thing that you

1419
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,050
0,120 120,180 180,510 510,630 630,750
want to check on your

1420
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,060
0,480 570,780 780,900 900,1590
guitar is the bridge.|

1421
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,800
0,150 150,450 450,540 540,780 780,1020
Your bridge is this right

1422
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,850
0,240 240,480 480,570 570,840 840,1050
here remember we talked about

1423
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,390
0,180 180,240 240,360 360,420 420,540
that you want to make

1424
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,710
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,1020 1020,1320
sure there's no gaps between

1425
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,730
0,180 180,270 270,330 330,720 720,1020
it and the sound board.|

1426
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,100
0,840 840,990 990,1110 1110,1290 1290,1710
There should be no gaps

1427
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,300
0,150 150,300 300,450 450,840 870,1200
if there is gaps, that

1428
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,620
0,210 210,360 360,690 690,1050 1170,1320
means it's pulling up and

1429
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,200
0,210 210,420 420,600 600,990
that's not good news.|

1430
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,650
0,420 450,660 660,960 960,1110 1110,1200
Um, you also want to

1431
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,030
0,150 150,780 990,1110 1110,1260 1260,1380
have adjusted and this is

1432
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,960
0,240 240,300 300,360 360,690 690,930
part of a set up

1433
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,140
0,690
job.|

1434
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,050
0,210 210,510 510,1050 1080,1350 1350,1710
Is your action, what action

1435
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,840
0,390 390,570 570,1260
is the distance.|

1436
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,490
0,150 150,270 270,870 900,1200 1200,1290
Of the strings from the

1437
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,290
0,270 270,630 750,1020 1020,1530 1530,1800
fret board, the higher this

1438
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,940
0,330 330,570 570,1020 1020,1260 1260,1650
is the wider that action

1439
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,740
0,420 450,750 750,960 960,1530 1530,1800
is, the more difficult that

1440
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,210
0,330 330,420 420,600 600,1170 1200,1470
guitar is going to be

1441
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,980
0,210 210,330 330,750 1050,1320 1320,1770
able to play the closer

1442
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,180
0,240 240,510 510,600 600,840 840,1200
that is to these threats,

1443
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,960
0,120 120,480 480,570 570,720 720,780
the easier it's going to

1444
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,010
0,90 90,270 270,330 330,720 780,1050
be able to play if

1445
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,030
0,120 120,510 510,600 600,930 930,1020
your guitar is hard and

1446
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,010
0,570 810,1170 1200,1680 1680,1830 1830,1980
difficult to finger and get

1447
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,330
0,210 210,450 450,660 660,930 930,1320
those notes down without buzzing

1448
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,190
0,360 360,510 510,840 840,1230 1320,1620
have your action checked that's

1449
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,790
0,180 180,270 270,330 330,390 390,600
probably one of the best

1450
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,780
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,720
things you could do.|

1451
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,220
0,210 210,270 270,480 480,660 660,810
How do you how should

1452
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,880
0,120 120,300 300,480 480,570 570,660
you take care of your

1453
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,530
0,390 510,900 900,1110 1110,1380 1410,1650
guitar well just for just

1454
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,340
0,90 90,90 90,450 450,600 600,810
for a second let's talk

1455
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,510
0,240 240,480 570,960 960,1050 1050,1170
about that, you don't want

1456
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,260
0,60 60,180 180,270 270,540 540,750
to get your guitar to

1457
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,120
0,450
hot.|

1458
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,490
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,720 1020,1170
You don't want you to

1459
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,720
0,150 150,270 270,540 540,750 750,1230
get your guitar to cold,

1460
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,550
0,450 450,570 570,870 870,1170 1170,1350
um, your guitar really is

1461
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,990
0,240 240,450 450,570 570,1020 1290,1440
just wood and glue and

1462
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,650
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,510 510,660
so if you get this

1463
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,450
0,210 210,390 390,840 1230,1620 1620,1800
thing too hot, um, it

1464
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,640
0,630 630,1230 1230,1380 1380,1650 1650,2190
starts warping and coming undone

1465
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,690
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,600 600,990
I can put a heat

1466
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,460
0,390 660,870 870,1050 1050,1590 1620,1770
lamp on this bridge and

1467
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,450
0,60 60,300 300,570 570,900 900,990
in about five minutes, it

1468
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,520
0,330 330,570 570,780
peels right up.|

1469
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,800
0,330 330,480 480,570 570,810 810,930
Um, so it really is

1470
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,730
0,210 210,420 420,630 630,780 780,930
just wooden glue so you

1471
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:18,210
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,420 420,480
want to make sure you

1472
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,350
0,150 150,270 270,600 600,930 930,1140
don't do stupid things like

1473
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,760
0,330 330,420 420,960 960,1110 1110,1290
take your guitar in the

1474
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,380
0,600 600,690 690,750 750,1320 1320,1470
car in the mall in

1475
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,540
0,60 60,270 270,330 330,1140 1830,2160
the middle of summertime that

1476
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,470
0,330 330,600 600,690 690,840 840,930
temperature inside your car is

1477
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,580
0,180 180,750 750,810 810,930 930,1110
probably going to get about

1478
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,680
0,600 600,1050 1050,1170 1170,1560 1860,2100
150 degrees at least that's

1479
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,670
0,330 330,570 570,660 660,780 780,990
well enough to do pretty

1480
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,990
0,330 330,690 690,750 750,870 870,1320
serious damage to your guitar

1481
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,860
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,480 480,660
so you just want to

1482
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,630
0,150 300,1020 1050,1410 1410,1530 1530,1770
be real careful with that,

1483
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,860
0,300 300,420 420,540 540,900 930,1140
it can be hot but

1484
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,800
0,210 210,450 450,690
not really hot.|

1485
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,940
0,360 360,480 480,570 570,690 690,750
Also, you don't want to

1486
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,410
0,120 120,210 210,600 630,1020 1020,1470
get your guitar super cold

1487
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,210
0,120 120,480 480,990 990,1230 1230,1800
or change temperature really fast

1488
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,140
0,240 240,300 300,360 360,630 630,690
it's in the middle of

1489
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,100
0,360 360,450 450,720 720,840 840,960
winter, your guitar has been

1490
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,060
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,720 810,960
out in the car, it's

1491
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,350
0,240 240,510 510,900 900,1080 1080,1290
well below freezing you bring

1492
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,670
0,90 90,300 570,900 900,1020 1020,1320
it in whip it out,

1493
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,290
0,180 180,300 300,360 360,870 870,1230
you're going to practice like

1494
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,460
0,240 240,390 390,630 630,720 720,960
like I said, you should

1495
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,750
0,210 210,750 750,960 960,1080 1080,1290
that's great, but you set

1496
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,410
0,90 90,330 330,540 540,600 600,660
your guitar next to a

1497
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,970
0,240 240,540 870,1260 1260,1410 1410,1560
heater vent that would be

1498
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,700
0,420
bad.|

1499
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,550
0,270 270,810 840,1080 1080,1260 1260,1710
Your guitar ever so slightly

1500
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,500
0,780 780,960 960,1560 1620,1890 1890,1950
expands and contracts, and it

1501
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,610
0,150 150,570 570,660 660,1020 1020,1110
would crack the finish on

1502
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,900
0,240 240,300 300,390 390,840 1080,1290
top of your guitar, it

1503
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,650
0,150 150,420 420,510 510,630 630,750
won't affect how it's going

1504
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,400
0,60 60,360 360,450 450,600 600,750
to sound but it's not

1505
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,150
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,510 510,750
going to look very pretty,

1506
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,990
0,180 180,360 360,570 570,660 660,840
from then on, and there's

1507
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,190
0,330 330,420 420,630 630,750 750,1200
once you crack your finish,

1508
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,750
0,240 240,420 420,600 600,810 810,930
there's no going back, it's

1509
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,770
0,150 150,450 450,510 510,930 930,1020
like cracking a windshield on

1510
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,520
0,60 60,420
a car.|

1511
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,650
0,540 540,810 900,1050 1050,1200 1200,1260
Last thing you want to

1512
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,940
0,300 360,750 750,960 960,1020 1020,1290
be careful not to set

1513
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,440
0,510 570,960 960,1260 1260,1350 1350,1500
anything on top of your

1514
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,910
0,480 840,1140 1140,1230 1230,1320 1320,1470
guitar, even when you put

1515
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,450
0,60 60,150 150,210 210,480 480,540
it in the case, you

1516
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:13,960
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,420 420,510
don't want to put your

1517
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,800
0,330 330,450 450,690 690,750 750,840
music on top of your

1518
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,970
0,360 390,570 570,750 750,930 930,1170
