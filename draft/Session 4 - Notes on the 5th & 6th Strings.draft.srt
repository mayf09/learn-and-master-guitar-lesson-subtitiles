notes on those strings once

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,410
0,90 90,450 450,720 720,870 870,990
we conquer those we have

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,550
0,420 420,690 690,780 780,1080 1080,1140

0,300 300,510 510,690 690,900 900,1020
And that's what today is

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,240
0,150 150,540 540,870 870,1140 1140,1440
all about wrapping up all

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,070
0,90 90,240 240,750 1020,1380 1380,1830
of our notes, we've learned

00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,660
0,660 660,720 720,840 840,1050 1050,1260
two-thirds of them so far

19
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,650
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,810 810,990

0,150 150,480 480,540 540,750 750,840
all together, we also need

23
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,890
0,60 60,300 300,360 360,420 420,630
to talk to you about

24
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,720
0,480 480,600 600,1140 1260,1710 1710,1830
sharps and flats playing in

25
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,550
0,330 330,930 1230,1470 1470,1530 1530,1830
different keys and we're going

26
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,930
0,210 210,420 420,810 810,1200 1200,1380
to more cords going a

27
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,430
0,540 600,750 750,900 900,1170 1320,1500
minor and an e so

0,120 120,630 750,1110 1110,1230 1230,1410
get started, let's go ahead

30
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,670
0,90 90,270 270,390 390,660 1050,1320
and have some fun, now

31
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,150
0,60 60,180 180,240 240,330 330,480
we're going to talk about

32
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,260
0,90 90,450 450,630 630,720 720,1110
the notes on the fifth

33
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,910
0,510 660,870 870,1140 1140,1350 1350,1650
string, here's three more notes

34
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,940
0,60 60,150 150,390 390,780
on the fifth string.|

35
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,420
0,450 450,630 630,750 750,900 900,1380
Starts out with an open

36
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,180
0,510 540,870 870,1170 1170,1710 2250,2760
a fifth string open is

37
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,880
0,1590
a.|

38
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,730
0,450 450,600 600,720 720,1740 2160,3600
Play one more time a.|

39
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,660
0,270 270,450 450,930 990,1260 1260,1500
Now you'll notice we're at

40
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,580
0,300 300,690 690,1080 1080,1470 1500,1920
two ledger lines deep underneath

41
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,030
0,240 240,750 990,1830 2070,2850 3060,3450
that staff guitar reads pretty

42
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,020
0,240 240,360 360,420 420,780 780,990
low on the staff will

43
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,400
0,570 570,750 750,960 960,1140 1140,1380
get as low as three

44
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,510
0,300 300,630 630,810 810,1050 1050,1110
ledger lines and when we

45
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,200
0,180 180,330 330,390 390,600 600,690
talk about the notes on

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,030
0,120 300,660 660,990 1170,1590 1590,1830
the sixth string but a

47
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,470
0,210 210,450 450,720 720,1020 1020,1440
that's two ledger lines down,

48
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,760
0,420 420,480 480,690 690,930 930,1080
take a good look at

49
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,660
0,120 120,510 510,570 570,750 750,900
it, sometimes it might get

50
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,800
0,480 480,570 570,660 660,900 900,1140
confusing when we start adding

51
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,820
0,240 240,480 480,810 810,960 960,1020
those ledger lines but the

52
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,810
0,240 240,330 330,480 480,690 840,990
more you do it the

53
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,470
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,600 600,660
better you'll get at it.|

54
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,470
0,210 210,660 660,900 900,1020 1020,1110
The second note on the

55
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,090
0,210 210,570 570,780 780,900 900,1620
fifth string is A B

56
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,370
0,210 210,330 330,900 900,1530 1770,1980
with our second finger on

57
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,660
0,60 60,540 540,990
the second fret.|

58
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,480
0,330 330,420 420,960
Here's a B.|

59
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,380
0,1440
HMM.|

60
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,560
0,180 180,300 300,450 450,600 600,690
Okay, now you try and

61
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,600
0,210 210,420 420,630 1020,1560
play with me ready.|

0,180 180,300 300,780 780,1140 1140,1230
Now the third note on

64
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,390
0,180 180,420 420,900 1170,1380 1380,1470
that fifth string is A

65
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,870
0,840 1140,1350 1350,1590 1590,2070 2070,3480
C we've learned a we've

66
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,360
0,360 360,900 960,2190 2190,2400 2400,2490
learned b and now we're

67
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,430
0,180 180,450 450,1050 1050,1530 1530,2070
gonna learn c, third finger,

68
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,380

third fret c.|

69
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,800
0,510 540,690 690,870 870,1290 1320,1950
Ready, let's play together c.|

00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,910
0,270 270,390 390,570 570,750 750,840
Let's go through all the

71
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,080
0,480 570,1290 1470,2100
notes a mm.|

72
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,910
0,1230 1440,2850 3000,3930 4590,6510 6810,7290
B. and c. do alright,

73
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,870
0,600 600,630 630,720 720,810 810,930
take a look at your

74
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,400
0,270 270,510 510,1260 1260,1350 1350,1530
fifth string exercises, we're going

75
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,540
0,90 90,390 390,750 750,870 870,1140
to number one on that.|

76
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,710
0,330 330,540 540,750 750,930 930,1080
We just work this out

77
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,570
0,90 90,420 450,750 750,1140 1260,1860
on those lower notes now.|

78
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,300
0,240 240,360 360,570 570,660 660,840
As we're getting to these

79
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,740
0,300 300,630 630,870 870,1260 1260,1440
lower notes make sure that

80
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,980
0,240 240,810
your wrist.|

81
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,780
0,420 540,1080 1080,1140 1140,1680 1710,1860
Is underneath the guitar, if

82
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,860
0,240 240,510 510,600 600,930 930,1080
your wrist is way up

83
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,210
0,540 750,1050 1050,1170 1170,1290 1290,1350
here then you're going to

84
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,500
0,210 210,450 450,570 570,660 660,1290
start running out of fingers

85
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,280
0,180 180,270 270,540 540,660 660,750
when we start when we

86
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,240
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,660 660,960
start trying to play notes

87
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,900
0,180 180,360 360,510 510,600 600,660
way down here on the

88
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,160
0,360 540,720 720,900 900,990 990,1260
neck, you got to lower

89
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,210
0,240 240,600 660,750 750,870 870,1050
that risk I know what

90
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,440
0,240 240,450 450,540 540,780 780,990
you want to put this

91
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,700
0,270 330,570 570,810 810,960 960,1260
up, that helps you with

92
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,050
0,120 120,390 390,840 930,1260 1260,1350
your hand strength, but you

93
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,160
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,600 600,1110
need to get these fingers

94
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,840
0,720 1020,1260 1260,1470 1470,1620 1620,1680
stronger so they need to

95
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,500
0,150 150,300 300,420 420,600 600,660
do what they need to

96
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,240
0,420 870,1200 1200,1440 1440,1500 1500,1740
do and part of that

97
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,590
0,150 150,600 600,870 870,1110 1110,1350
is lowering that risk down

98
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,610
0,90 90,300 300,510 600,780 780,1020
a little bit, so keep

99
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,510
0,210 210,450 450,660 660,750 750,900
that wrist nice and low

100
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,140
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,510 510,630
make sure you've got some

101
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,430
0,210 210,600 600,810 810,930 930,1290

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,890
0,180 180,660 900,1650 1650,2100 2250,2700
our first position notes when

221
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,640
0,30 30,330 330,540 540,570 570,750
I mean when I say

222
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,900
0,300 300,660 660,780 780,960 960,1260
first position, I mean down

223
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,570
0,390 420,780 780,1230 1560,2100 2370,2670

0,90 90,180 180,720 750,1290 1290,1410
of the guitar position when

225
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,540
0,30 30,210 210,810 840,1140 1140,1560
I say position that refers

226
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,130
0,330 660,870 870,1230 1230,1410 1410,1590
to your fret that you're

227
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,210
0,300 330,750 750,870 870,990 990,1080
on sometimes you'll be in

228
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,860
0,90 90,540 540,1110 1170,1440 1440,1650
the fifth position that means

229
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,240
0,150 150,570 570,690 690,1080
you start your hand.|

230
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,160
0,210 210,300 300,630 630,1260
On the fifth position.|

231
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,150
0,180 180,270 270,630 630,1020 1290,1500
On the fifth fret, its

232
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,380
0,270 270,690 690,840 840,1110 1110,1230
third position you'd start your

233
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,460
0,360 540,690 690,810 810,900 900,1080
hand and you do your

234
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,170
0,420 420,720 720,990 990,1380 1410,1710
fingers remember first finger, second

235
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,940
0,210 210,450 450,840 900,1380 1380,1770
finger, third finger pinky covers

236
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,470
0,540 960,1170 1170,1260 1260,1350 1350,1530
both that would be like

237
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,250
0,60 60,480 480,600 600,690 690,780
a position that would be

238
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,570
0,90 90,600 810,1080 1080,1200 1200,1320
in third but we're going

239
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,440

0,390 390,480 480,690 690,780 780,960
position and that's where we've

241
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,360
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,510 510,960

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,460
0,390
time.|

316
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,700
0,180 180,300 300,660 1020,1740

0,210 210,390 390,450 450,540 540,600
Okay, now we need to

325
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,350
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,660 660,1200
talk about one more concept.|

326
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,820
0,840 840,1080 1080,1530 1530,1650 1650,1740
Sharps and flats, now I'm

327
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,680
0,240 240,360 360,510 510,1050 1620,1860
sure you've been wondering we've

328
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,090
0,330 360,660 660,780 780,1170 1170,1410
got on this first stream,

329
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,890
0,120 120,300 300,690 690,1260 1440,1800
we've got open first and

330
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,210
0,480 480,570 570,720 720,930 930,1110
third but what about what's

331
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,130
0,150 150,360 360,450 450,1110 1560,1920
this note in between what's

332
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,990
0,240 240,630 810,1290 1320,1740 1740,1860
that note well just like

333
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,190
0,150 150,240 240,570 570,1020 1020,1200
there are black keys and

334
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,840
0,360 360,720 720,900 900,960 960,1650
white keys on a piano,

335
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,220
0,300 300,390 390,510 510,750 750,900
each of them being a

336
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,740
0,330 330,660 660,1290
half step apart.|

337
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,920
0,150 150,750 750,1170 1170,1530 1530,1710
A guitar every fret that

338
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,150
0,180 180,480 480,690 690,780 780,1230
you see on the neck

339
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,070
0,150 150,630 630,930 930,1230 1230,1800
is exactly one half step

340
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,860
0,180 180,540 540,1200
and different notes.|

341
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,360
0,300 300,480 480,540 540,720 720,960
Either have a half step

342
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,350
0,90 90,420 420,570 600,750 750,990
in between them or don't

343
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,640
0,180 180,240 240,480 480,840 840,1290
have a half step in

344
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,580
0,360 360,600
between them.|

345
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,620
0,480 480,570 570,780 780,1230 1380,1620
Half and whole steps is

346
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,370
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,660 660,750
what this is called when

347
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,420
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,750 750,1050
you have two half steps

348
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,680
0,150 150,630 720,1050 1050,1170 1170,1260
put together makes up a

349
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,560
0,210 210,600
whole step.|

350
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,940
0,420 420,660 660,750 750,1050 1050,1260
But each of these is

351
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,490
0,630 1170,1590 1590,1950 1980,2460 2460,2550
one half step apart, so

352
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,120
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,570 570,630
let's now we're going to

353
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,810
0,120 120,270 270,360 360,570 570,690
talk about the notes that

354
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,950
0,60 60,240 240,600 600,690 690,1140
are in between the notes.|

355
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,610
0,330 330,540 540,840 840,930 930,1140
There's two ways to look

356
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,020
0,180 180,360 720,1080 1080,1200 1200,1410
at him let's talk about

357
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,150
0,570 570,1080 1350,1590 1590,1770 1770,2130
sharp's, first the little number

358
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,740
0,600 630,990 990,1350 1350,1500 1500,1590
sign looking symbol is a

359
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,660
0,480 480,960 1200,1470 1470,1680 1680,1920
sharp sign what that means,

360
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,920
0,90 90,240 240,510 510,990 990,1260
is it takes whatever note

361
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,780
0,180 180,510
that you.|

362
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,160
0,180 180,300 300,510 510,600 600,840
Is in front of it,

363
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,840
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,780 780,1170
you see the sharp sign

364
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,310
0,270 270,600 600,840 840,1110 1110,1260
you raise that note up

365
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,230
0,540 540,930 930,1200 1200,1500 1500,1920
one half step one {fret's

366
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,240
0,60 60,600 1020,1260 1260,1380 1380,2010
-} worth on your guitar.|

367
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,980
0,120 120,300 300,450 450,900 900,1200
And that's what sharps do

368
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,090
0,300 300,540 540,660 660,720 720,960
you've learned all the notes

369
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,110
0,150 150,420 450,720 720,840 840,1020
so far, now we're just

370
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,100
0,120 120,180 180,540 540,750 750,990
going to adjust those notes

371
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,150
0,60 60,240 240,390 390,660 660,1050
a little bit using sharps

372
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,230
0,120 120,510 570,870 870,1020 1020,1080
and flats, let's look at

373
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,910
0,60 60,420 420,720 720,1170 1440,1680
the sharp line first, we're

374
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,980
0,120 120,210 210,720
going to start.|

375
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,200
0,270 270,600 600,930 930,1290 1290,1620
On this f first finger

376
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,360
0,510
f.|

377
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,700
0,600 1320,1830 1830,2220 2220,2430 2430,2940
Now remember finger rule supply,

378
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,780
0,390 510,750 750,810 810,990 990,1080
so when I go to

379
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,100
0,240 240,510 510,1020 1020,1200 1200,1320
this f sharp which would

380
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,920
0,120 120,450 450,1050
be right here.|

381
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,960
0,180 180,570 570,930 930,1080 1080,1380
My second finger would cover

382
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,240
0,270 990,1410 1410,1650 1650,1950 1950,2280
that first finger covers everything

383
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,380
0,90 90,180 180,480 480,900 930,1140
in the first fret on

384
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,450
0,240 240,690 690,1260 1470,1770 1770,2070
all strings, second covers anything

385
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,130
0,90 90,150 150,630 780,1410 1410,1680
on the second third covers

386
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,110
0,330 330,390 390,510 510,930 1230,1980
anything on the third pinky.|

387
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,810
0,270 270,570 570,870 870,1140 1140,1230
Pulls double duty anything that

388
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,770
0,240 240,300 300,390 390,750 750,960
happens on the fourth or

389
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,380
0,120 120,750 1020,1410 1410,1950 2400,2610
the fifth pinkie covers so

390
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,730
0,120 120,300 300,870 990,1110 1110,1350
we have f and now

391
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,720
0,150 150,450 450,690 690,1560
we've got f sharp.|

392
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,620
0,690 960,1170 1170,1350 1350,1830 1890,2880
Okay, and we've got g.|

393
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,410
0,90 90,180 180,330 330,600 600,840
And then we've got g

394
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,720
0,1140
sharp.|

395
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,320
0,210 210,390 390,780 780,1140 1380,1560
On this next ring, we

396
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
0,120 120,330 330,420 420,1140
would have a C.|

397
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,360
0,270 270,330 330,660 660,1080 1080,1200
Then A C sharp with

398
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,920
0,90 90,510 510,1140
our second finger.|

399
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,480
0,1560
D.|

400
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,900
0,180 180,330 330,570 570,960 960,1110
Then A D sharp with

401
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,160
0,120 120,720 870,2880

402
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,590
0,180 180,270 270,630 630,990 990,1170
On the third string, we

403
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,590
0,120 120,540 990,1470 1470,2610 2760,3000
would have open g now

404
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,670
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,750 750,1080
how do I sharpen open

405
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,620
0,540 870,1350 1500,1650 1650,1860 1860,1950
string, well you put your

0,450 450,1020 1410,1710 1710,1920 1920,2280
first finger on that string,

407
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,500
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,510 510,600
and that would be A

408
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,920
0,360 360,1020 1140,1650 1800,3270 3270,3420
G sharp there OK so

409
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,300
0,60 60,240 240,930 960,1170 1170,1380
we have g we've got

410
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,340
0,240 240,960
g sharp.|

411
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,910
0,450 450,720 720,870 870,1050 1050,1890
Second finger would be a.|

412
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,410
0,300 300,480 480,600 600,750 750,840
After that would be an

413
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,000
0,270 270,1470
a sharp.|

414
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,570
0,510 1380,1590 1590,1860 1890,2310 2310,2880
Okay on the fourth string,

415
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,310
0,180 180,420 420,1320 1350,1500 1500,1620
we have dean, how did

416
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,230
0,120 120,510 510,750 750,1320 1320,1920
we sharpen open string, put

417
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,370
0,120 120,480 480,840 840,960 960,1140
our first finger on that

418
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,520
0,330 330,660 690,1200 1200,2040
first fret d sharp.|

419
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,260
0,1200 1200,1470 1470,1740 1740,1830 1830,2070
Ii up, here's our first

420
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,060
0,510 930,1260 1260,1320 1320,1560 1560,1800
problem if I wanted an

421
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,120
0,120 120,810
e sharp.|

422
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,980
0,180 180,300 300,570 570,1440 1440,1500
That would be on the

423
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,060
0,300 300,690
third fret.|

424
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,450
0,150 150,360 360,630 630,720 720,990
But that's already an f

425
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,530
0,120 120,360 360,600 600,660 660,1080
you're probably saying to yourself

426
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,060
0,240 240,660 660,930 930,1200 1200,1500
you're exactly right Andy sharp

427
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,560
0,240 240,600 1080,1350 1350,1440 1440,1500
isn't F F is the

428
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,460
0,150 150,480 480,690 690,810 810,900
more common name so you

429
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,540
0,300 300,450 450,660 660,750 750,1080
hardly ever hear it referred

430
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,620
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,540 540,1080
to as an e sharp,

431
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,790
0,360 360,450 450,630 630,1080 1080,1140
but I guess technically it

432
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,660
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,480 480,870
would be an e sharp.|

433
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,480
0,1080 1080,1290 1290,1440 1440,1620 1620,2280
Zeff when an f sharp,

434
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,800
0,510 510,690 690,780 780,1140 1140,1320
we got our pinky over

435
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,720
0,510
here.|

436
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,960
0,120 120,390 390,690 690,870 870,1170
The fifth stream got open

437
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,010
0,360 360,510 510,570 570,840 840,1050
a if I wanted a

438
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,700
0,780 810,1680 1680,2310
sharp be there.|

439
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,140
0,810
B.|

440
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,960
0,240 240,420 420,900 900,1050 1050,1200
Then be sharp or more

441
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,150
0,390 390,630 630,750 750,840 840,2190
commonly known to A C,

442
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,200
0,180 180,510 510,1710
then c sharp.|

443
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,990
0,180 180,240 240,540 540,1080 1530,1710
On the last string, let's

444
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,070
0,150 150,360 360,420 420,570 570,1080
just start on the f

445
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,790
0,420 420,720 720,900 900,2280 2310,2640
second finger f sharp third

446
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,720
0,300 300,1620 1770,2190 2190,3030 3660,3930
finger G G sharp, see

447
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,820
0,150 150,390 390,780 1110,1710 1710,2100
how those work sharps sharps

448
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,080
0,210 210,480 480,570 570,810 810,1260
go up a half step

449
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,160
0,240 240,390 390,570 570,720 720,840
now let's talk about the

450
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,570
0,390 390,660 870,1080 1080,1200 1200,1410
opposite way I can take

451
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,350
0,60 60,270 300,480 480,570 570,780
a note up a half

452
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,760
0,390 390,750 750,1020 1020,1170 1170,1410
step, but I can also

453
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,600
0,180 180,240 240,540 540,660 660,840
take a note and bring

454
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,920
0,210 210,600 600,690 690,930 930,1320
it down a half step

455
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,480
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,810 810,1500
and those are called flats.|

456
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,530
0,330 330,450 450,570 570,660 660,1230
When it is a flat

457
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,660
0,420 420,600 600,870 870,1170 1170,1800
that's that little b it

458
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,800
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,810 810,1140
looks like a talus ized

459
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,210
0,420 540,780 780,840 840,1200 1200,1410
b that's a flat sign

460
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,200
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,780 780,990
when you see that by

461
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,370
0,60 60,390 420,780 780,1050 1050,1170
a note you play the

462
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,770
0,480 900,1080 1080,1560 1560,1890 1890,2400
note a half step down

463
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,440
0,240 240,780 1920,2160 2160,2310 2310,2550
from where we had done

464
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,580
0,510 510,660 660,750 750,930 930,1140
initially if it were just

465
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,350
0,420 630,1140 1230,1470 1470,1650 1650,1770
plain OK, so let's do

466
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,420
0,90 90,300 300,360 360,810
a few of these.|

467
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,310
0,390 390,540 540,630 630,720 720,1560
Starts out on A g.

468
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,660
0,180 180,300 300,360 360,540 540,630
now if I want A

469
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,740
0,240 240,540 540,690 690,840 840,1080
G flat I would not

470
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,540
0,390 510,780 780,1110 1110,1590 1620,1800
go up this way I

471
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,290
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,660 660,750
wouldn't go this way on

472
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,220
0,60 60,360 390,660 660,780 780,930
the neck I would go

473
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,860
0,240 240,480 480,690 690,1050 2460,2640
back down this way, what

474
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,030
0,180 180,300 300,390 390,690 690,1170
should be A G flat.|

475
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,140
0,330 330,570 660,1470
Got it, g.|

476
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,220
0,450 450,900 1410,1560 1560,1710 1710,1740
G flat, now wait a

477
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,630
0,270 690,870 870,990 990,1200 1200,1410
minute, where was that f

478
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,440
0,270 270,390 390,510 510,750 750,810
sharp that we learned a

479
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,580
0,150 150,300 300,750
little bit ago.|

480
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,480
0,870 1200,1500 1500,2340
F F sharp.|

481
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,580
0,240 240,510 510,660 660,900 900,1380
F sharp and g flat

482
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,990
0,180 180,240 240,570 570,960 990,1200
are the same note you're

483
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,130
0,150 150,420 420,570 570,780 930,1140
just looking at it from

484
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,900
0,330 330,870 870,990 990,1590 1590,1770
different perspectives if I'm on

485
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,280
0,450 540,750 750,840 840,1020 1020,1380
F I would look up

486
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,210
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,480 480,690
there would be an f

487
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,200
0,420 570,660 660,750 750,900 900,990
sharp if I met A

488
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,640
0,480 480,660 660,930 930,1230 1230,1440
G, I'm looking down on

489
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,050
0,180 330,810 810,1050 1140,1320 1320,1410
it flat, it would be

490
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,280
0,90 90,360 360,750 900,1140 1140,1230
A G flat, so when

491
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,960
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,810 1110,1680
you get into these, um

492
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,580
0,330 330,420 420,780 780,1170 1440,1620
sharps and flats notes a

493
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,720
0,180 180,240 240,630 630,870 870,1140
lot of times they'll have

494
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,650
0,180 180,480 480,630 630,780 780,930
you come out from either

495
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,580
0,480 480,600 600,660 660,780 780,930
direction so you have two

496
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,690
0,300 300,420 420,480 480,780 780,1110
names for the same note.|

497
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,500
0,180 180,270 270,420 420,1020 1050,1200
So we have g we

498
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,330
0,120 120,390 390,960 1560,1740 1740,1830
have g flat, then we

499
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,840
0,210 210,840
have f.|

500
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,860
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,810 960,1680
Go down the neck open,

501
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,450
0,150 150,390 390,510 510,810 810,1320
and here's our first problem.|

502
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,030
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,1080 1080,1230
How do I flat an

503
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,350
0,330 330,840 870,960 960,1200 1200,1320
open string I can't get

504
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,580
0,120 120,390 390,570 570,810 810,1230
any lower than open string,

505
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,650
0,150 150,540 540,1140 1230,1410 1410,1560
the rule says you go

506
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,090
0,360 360,450 450,570 570,870 870,1440
down to the next string

507
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,320
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,450 450,780
which would be the second

508
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,030
0,390 570,720 720,1020 1020,1140 1140,1710
string and use your pinky.|

509
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,390
0,1020 1050,1230 1230,1470 1470,1620 1620,1710
So, so that would be

510
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,720
0,180 180,360 360,900
an e flat.|

511
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,840
0,150 150,420 420,540 540,660 660,780
The rule is you go

512
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,100
0,270 270,330 330,420 420,660 660,1260
down to the next string

513
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,050
0,180 180,420 420,540 540,1110 1440,1650
and use your pinky, so

514
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,030
0,300 300,690 1380,1680 1680,1830 1830,1980
here's a here's an e

515
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,670
0,540 570,1560 1560,1740 1740,2070 2070,2640
flat, let's keep going, D

516
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,540
0,1500 1500,2130
D flat.|

517
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,120
0,930 1200,2580 2580,3150
See zen bi.|

518
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,270
0,300 300,810 1320,1440 1440,1770 1770,2280
Okay, here's the one exception

519
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,960
0,60 60,180 180,420 420,630 630,690
to the rule here I

520
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,950
0,150 150,360 360,510 510,870 870,990
just taught you rule and

521
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,430
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,360 360,480
this is going to be

522
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,330
0,60 60,270 270,720 720,780 780,900
the one exception to the

523
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,000
0,360
rule.|

524
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,570
0,480 480,570 570,930 930,1200 1200,1380
On the third string just

525
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,200
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,480 480,630
has to do with how

526
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,850
0,90 90,450 450,570 570,1320 1320,1650
the guitar is tuned and

527
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,050
0,210 210,390 390,720 750,1080 1080,1200
how it's been tuned over

528
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,940
0,120 120,570
the ages.|

529
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,700
0,240 240,480 480,1020 1020,1200 1200,1260
A B flat, which is

530
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,570
0,150 150,270 270,510 510,720 720,870
what we're going for would

531
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,470
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,570 570,900
not be with your pinky

532
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,190
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,480 480,720
which is what the rule

533
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,450
0,150 150,510 900,1110 1110,1200 1200,1260
would say this is the

534
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,220
0,180 180,1080 1140,1290 1290,1500 1500,1770
one exception A B flat

535
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,870
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,990 1020,1650
is with your third finger.|

536
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,600
0,780 1020,1680 1680,2250
B B flat.|

537
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,880
0,840 1650,2640 2790,4140 4230,4470 4470,4560
A flat g, now we're

538
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,780
0,210 210,300 300,420 420,630 630,900
back to our rule again,

539
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,650
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,630 630,870
how do we flatten open

540
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,390
0,450 750,1260 1260,1410 1410,1590 1590,1740
string fourth we go the

541
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,650
0,330 330,720 720,810 810,1020 1020,1260
fourth finger the next string

542
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,920
0,420 450,1170 1170,1680 2340,3000
down g flat f.|

543
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,840
0,930
E.|

544
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,440
0,330 330,1020 1590,2520 2550,2730 2730,2910
E flat d, let's keep

545
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,090
0,360 360,630 630,1830 1860,2760 2790,4650
going d flat c B.|

546
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,820
0,420 420,1140
B flat.|

547
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,760
0,960
A.|

548
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,660
0,420 420,1080 1110,2490 2490,2580 2580,2790
Hey, flat g we're giving

549
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,860
0,120 120,450 450,540 540,720 720,1200
our pinky a good workout

550
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,660
0,240 240,780 1770,2730
g flat f.|

551
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,040
0,390 390,630 840,1110 1110,1290 1290,1590
Very good and that's sharps

552
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,840
0,120 120,510
and flats.|

553
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,360
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,1020 1020,1050
Okay, one more concept, I

554
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,020
0,150 150,210 210,420 420,480 480,660
need to tell you about

555
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,820
0,90 90,420 420,540 540,1020 1290,1800
in sharps and flats sharps

556
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,860
0,120 120,690 810,1080 1080,1200 1200,2040
and flats have a time

557
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,540
0,720 720,960 960,1200
duration on them.|

558
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,870
0,450 450,1050 1110,1320 1320,1500 1500,1770
Time duration what that means

559
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,800
0,150 150,360 360,450 450,780 780,930
is they are good for

560
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,060
0,270 270,840 930,1110 1110,1170 1170,1260
one measure, so if you

561
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,230
0,150 150,240 240,330 330,810 810,1170
look in your example there.|

562
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,460
0,240 270,990
And f.|

563
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,310
0,360 360,480 480,570 570,810 810,1290
Going to an f sharp

564
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,660
0,240 240,330 330,690 690,930 930,1350
once I sharp that f

565
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,340
0,150 150,420 660,930 930,1110 1110,1590
then that f is sharp

566
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,390
0,210 210,300 300,570 570,660 660,720
for the rest of the

567
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,710
0,510 600,780 780,960 960,1200 1200,1320
measure no matter whether it's

568
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,360
0,270 270,630 630,930 930,1290
high f low f.|

569
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,640
0,120 120,510 510,810 810,930 930,1080
Or media math would know

570
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,230
0,540 540,960 1020,1290 1290,1380 1380,1590
whatever f soon as one

571
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,790
0,330 330,750 840,1200 1200,1470 1470,1560
f sharp all f's are

572
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,350
0,420 570,840 840,930 930,1320 1320,1560
sharp for the complete rest

573
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,220
0,60 60,120 120,540 570,810 810,870
of the measure, once I

574
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,230
0,180 180,450 660,1020 1020,1410 1680,2010
hit that bar line then

575
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,420
0,90 90,540 540,870
it resets again.|

576
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,440
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,660 660,840
Now, what if I get

577
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,390
0,60 60,420 750,1230 1230,1440 1440,1950
to that second f sharp

578
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,350
0,150 150,240 240,450 450,660 660,840
and I really don't want

579
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,860
0,90 90,150 150,270 270,360 360,510
it to be an f

580
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,880
0,210 210,330 330,480 480,540 540,1020
sharp, how can I cancel

581
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,320
0,120 120,420 930,1230 1230,1380 1380,1440
it out, that's where you

582
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,580
0,210 210,270 270,810 810,1140 1140,1260
use a natural sign a

583
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,820
0,420 420,930
natural sign.|

584
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,610
0,600 750,1110 1110,1320 1320,1470 1470,1530
Um looks like kind of

585
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,990
0,240 240,600 600,900 900,1020 1020,1380
two l's backed up against

586
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,940
0,150 150,510 600,960 960,1590 1590,1950
each other that cancels out

587
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,680
0,150 150,750 750,1080 1080,1470 1470,1530
a previously held sharp or

588
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,060
0,330 720,900 900,1050 1050,1110 1110,1380
flat, we're going to learn

589
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,350
0,240 240,570 570,630 630,870 1020,1260
two chords a day going

590
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,030
0,180 180,390 390,930 1320,1470 1470,1680
to a minor and an

591
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,680
0,330
e.|

592
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,410
0,180 180,660 690,1050 1050,1260 1260,1320
The um standing next to

593
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,270
0,180 1080,1470 1470,1620 1620,1680 1680,1860
the standing next to the

594
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,250
0,270 270,360 360,990 1170,1320 1320,1410
that's the minor it's a

595
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,840
0,300 300,420 420,870 870,1080 1080,1590
symbol for miners a miner.|

596
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,240
0,390 390,540 540,690 690,780 780,930
Let's go through it, let's

597
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,720
0,150 150,180 180,330 330,390 390,480
take a look at the

598
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,640
0,420
minor.|

599
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,920
0,360 360,600 600,900 900,990 990,1080
There's nothing happening on the

600
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,600
0,270 270,630 930,1200 1200,1440 1440,1680
sixth string the fifth string

601
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
0,150 150,600
is open.|

602
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,640
0,180 180,240 240,540 540,780 780,870
On the fourth string, you

603
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,180
0,120 120,210 210,630 630,1170
have your second finger.|

604
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,650
0,390 390,630 630,750 750,870 870,990
Third string you have your

605
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,880
0,390 390,690 690,990 990,1110 1110,1230
third finger down there on

606
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,800
0,60 60,420 420,810 1110,1620 1620,1920
the second fret first finger

607
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,390
0,150 150,360 360,930 1380,1530 1530,1590
on that c and the

608
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,680
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,990
last string is open.|

609
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,920
0,150 150,390 390,480 480,780 810,1080
I played him in each

610
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,060
0,150 150,630 630,750 750,990 990,1140
note individually would sound like

611
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,360
0,390
this.|

612
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,980
0,540 540,1410
Boom boom.|

613
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,380
0,210 1140,3120 3150,4140
One more time.|

614
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,960
0,750 840,1470 1470,2670

0,150 150,300 300,690 690,840 840,1110
go the opposite way, instead

870
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,960
0,60 60,270 270,480 480,570 570,780
of going up a half

871

0,390 390,870 870,960 960,1080 1080,1260
step which would be this

872
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,450
0,180 180,300 300,360 360,690 990,1230

0,480 480,750
opposite way.|

933
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,540
0,540 1110,1860 3510,4500
One to two.|

934
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,080
0,1020 1170,1890
One two.|

0,7710 7770,8880 9090,10020 11190,11880

0,210 210,360 360,900 1320,1440 1440,1530
Now you'll notice in the

941
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,280
0,390 390,840 870,1020 1020,1170 1170,1230
last measure you have a

942
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,050
0,420 420,750 990,1410 1410,1590 1590,1770
half note, where's it should

943
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,070
0,180 180,450 450,750 750,870 870,1020
have three beats in it

944
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,320
0,420 420,570 570,840 840,1260 1680,2100
where's the other beat that

945
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,580
0,330 330,540 540,810 810,1020 1020,1260
makes up for where those

946
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,990
0,420 420,690 690,930 1080,1230 1230,1410
pickups came in if there's

947
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,860
0,60 60,450 450,720 720,810 810,870
a partial measure at the

948
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,940
0,480 570,840 840,960 960,1020 1020,1080
beginning, there's going to be

949
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,960
0,60 60,480 480,780 780,840 840,1020
a partial measure at the

950
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,580
0,240 360,1080 1080,1230 1290,1500 1500,1620
end truncate it so that

951
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,570
0,150 150,480 480,750 750,900 900,990
they both match up to

952
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,010
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,900 1200,1440
make a full measure why

953
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,640
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,540 540,630
they do that I don't

954
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,360
0,60 60,240 240,360 360,510 510,720
know why they do that,

955
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,260
0,330 330,480 480,540 540,690 690,780
that's kind of how it

956
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,910
0,300 570,900 900,1110 1110,1320 1320,1650
is let's play star spangled

957
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,140
0,210 210,450 450,600 600,960 990,1230
banner one more time, this

958
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,280
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,720 720,1140
time a little bit faster

959
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,510
0,210 210,300 300,780 840,1110 1110,1230
up to tempo now you'll

960
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,980
0,360 390,630 630,900 900,1020 1020,1470
notice the rhythm is slightly

961
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,270
0,450 480,750 750,930 930,1050 1050,1290
different from how we sing

962
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,700
0,180
it.|

963
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,250
0,390 390,660 660,780 780,990 990,1230
That's because we haven't quite

964
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:41,760
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,450 450,510
got to some of the

965
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,080
0,180 180,720 720,1050 1050,1260 1260,1320
more complex rhythms yet of

966
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,970
0,390 390,1050 1050,1350 1350,1560 1560,1890
which star spangled banner has

967
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,780
0,120 120,300 300,420 420,510 510,810
in it and are more

968
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,010
0,360 360,660 660,1020 1020,1140 1140,1230
common vocal version of it,

969
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
0,300 300,540 540,720 720,930 930,1080
so just bear with us,

970
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,780
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,360 360,540
if you want to throw

971
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,920
0,240 240,480 570,810 810,1020 1020,1140
this in your more than

972
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,850

0,210 210,270 270,480 480,630 630,840
pick it up a little

974
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,380
0,300 300,390 390,480 480,540 540,690
bit and do it one

975
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,060
0,120 120,450
more time.|

976

0,210 210,330 330,420 420,480 480,990
Little bit of a pause

985
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,520

0,120 120,330 330,480 480,600 600,840
They see how I just

990
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,660
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,480 480,630
did the rhythm a little

991
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,530
0,180 180,240 240,330 330,600 600,870
bit to be more like

992
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,730
0,180 180,540 540,930 930,1050 1050,1170
our vocal version of it

993
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,990
0,330 360,570 570,690 690,840 840,870
okay now let's take a

994
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,580
0,240 240,360 360,720 720,1230 1260,1590
look at simple gifts now

995
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,900
0,150 150,630 660,840 840,1020 1020,1320
you'll notice in this one

996
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
0,240 240,330 330,750 750,1200 1320,1680
there's a sharp sign way

997
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,600
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,600 600,960
up at the very beginning

998
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,260
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,570 570,660
it's not even by a

999
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,060
0,270 270,330 330,750 1080,1530 1530,1800
note or anything, that's called

1000
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,320
0,30 30,330 330,870 870,990 990,1260
a key signature we'll talk

1001
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,430
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,930 930,1110
more about those later, but

1002
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,420
0,240 240,480 480,750 750,930 930,990
all this means kind of

1003
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,800
0,270 270,750 750,1170 1170,1290 1290,1380
a global setting on your

1004
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,900
0,540 1020,1530 1530,1860
computer, once that.|

1005
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,300
0,240 240,300 300,630 630,840 840,1050
There's a sharp sign over

1006
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,560
0,240 240,480 480,750 750,990 990,1260
that f, that means that

1007
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,150
0,390 390,810 840,990 990,1110 1110,1590
every f in the entire

1008
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,710
0,510 660,930 930,1170 1170,1470 1470,1560
song whether high medium or

1009
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,550
0,390 420,570 570,690 690,750 750,840
low is going to be

1010
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,400
0,510
sharp.|

1011
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,740
0,180 180,240 240,420 420,540 540,660
And it doesn't even have

1012
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,490
0,60 60,150 150,210 210,480 480,750
to have a sharp sign

1013
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,840
0,210 210,390 390,780 780,1080 1080,1350
by it once that sharp

1014
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,470
0,210 210,330 330,480 480,540 540,630
sign is up in the

1015
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,550
0,270 270,750 750,930 930,1020 1020,1080
key signature right up at

1016
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,330
0,120 120,300 300,360 360,420 420,780
the front of the song

1017
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,650
0,210 210,450 450,840 840,1140 1140,1290
that means every F U

1018
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,480
0,480 990,1200 1200,1350 1350,1470 1470,1830
C is going to be.|

0,180 180,360 360,900 1170,1740 1770,2010
An f sharp okay whether

1020
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,250
0,120 120,630 660,1380 1440,1620 1620,2040
it's high medium or low,

1021
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,440
0,600
okay.|

1022
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,720
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,780 810,1110
