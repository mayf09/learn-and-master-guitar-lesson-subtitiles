31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,780
0,390 390,600 600,900
position should be.|

32
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,440
0,570 600,780 780,930 930,1020 1020,1320

0,240 240,750 750,990 990,1410 1680,1830
pic position right here, we're

0,120 120,480 600,1080 1080,1260 1260,1320
it too loose, if we

38
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,690
0,210 210,270 270,420 420,660 660,750

0,180 180,390 390,630 630,810 810,960
just doesn't work well with

40
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,820
0,480 630,870 870,960 960,1110 1110,1170

43
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,240
0,630 690,1050 1050,1290
strength in it.|

44
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,620

46
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,630
0,90 90,300 300,450 450,870 870,1110

a little bit of air

52
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,150
0,360 360,750 900,1020 1020,1140 1140,1260

0,90 90,240 240,360 360,420 420,810
you don't need to brace

59
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,540
0,150 150,270 270,480 480,1080 1170,1440
when you're doing chords, we've

we need to do when

71
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,600
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,1080 1380,1890

ones, and it may be

102
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,450
0,30 30,180 180,660 660,720 720,930
a little confusing to keep

103
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,440
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,720 720,990
up with the names but

104
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,030
0,60 60,270 270,540 1020,1200 1200,1590
I did it to introduce

105
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,660
0,90 90,300 300,420 420,540 540,630
the ones that would be

106
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,370
0,120 120,660 660,1140 1230,1440 1440,1710
the easiest first, so here's

107
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,390
0,120 120,450 450,690 690,780 780,1020
the first batch of chords

108
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,140
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,360 360,750
that we're going to cover

109
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,760
0,300 300,750 750,960 960,1140 1140,1320
now actually I've already kind

110
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,260
0,60 60,510 510,810 870,1110 1110,1500
of snuck in the first

111
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,220
0,390 390,540 540,660 660,870 870,960
for that we need to

112
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,740
0,360
do.|

113
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,980
0,360 360,660 660,1380 1410,1830 1830,2040
Way back in session two

114
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,090
0,120 120,390 390,450 450,840 870,1110
I believe it was we

115
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,980
0,300 300,360 360,810 810,1380 1620,1890
covered A C chord, let's

116
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,090
0,270 270,420 420,480 480,780 780,1110
review what A C chord

117
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,400
0,390 720,1020 1020,1410 1410,1980 2160,2310
is the six string, we

118
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
0,180 180,330 330,720 720,900 900,960
don't have anything on it

119
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,320
0,210 210,330 330,570 570,750 750,960
there's an X over that

120
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,280
0,300 300,720
chord block.|

121
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,810
0,330 330,630 630,720 720,870 870,990
Fifth string I've got my

122
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,100
0,420 420,990
third finger.|

123
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,440
0,450 450,930 960,1140 1140,1320 1320,1440
Fourth string I've got my

124
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,700
0,420 420,960
second finger.|

125
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,800
0,450 450,690 690,900 900,1530
Third string is open.|

126
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,290
0,480 480,1230 1230,1740 1740,1860 1860,2010
First, fingers c on that

127
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,400
0,330 330,780
second string.|

128
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,820
0,120 120,180 180,390 390,600 600,720
And the last string is

129
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,830
0,390 720,960 960,1140 1140,1710 1710,2010
open let's play altogether, each

130
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,300
0,180 180,900
note individually.|

131
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,400
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,840 840,1230
Make sure they're all sounding

132
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,110
0,660 900,1020 1020,1380 1380,1500 1500,1710
clean and sounding out nice

133
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,280
0,90 90,450 450,630 630,990 990,1170
and strong, no buzz one

134
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,840
0,120 660,2310
more time.|

135
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,040
0,240 240,840
Not together.|

136
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,790
0,240 240,660 660,750 750,900 900,1020
Now, sometimes it may be

137
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,660
0,330 330,420 420,480 480,570 570,870
hard for you to grab

138
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,710
0,60 60,300 300,360 360,570 570,1050
a couple of these chords,

139
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,670
0,240 240,360 360,570 570,720 720,930
if you want to kind

140
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,200
0,60 60,120 120,540 540,930 1260,1530
of the easy way to

141
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,130
0,120 120,300 300,360 360,540 540,930
do some of these chords

142
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,910
0,180 180,390 390,480 480,690 690,780
is just to take the

143
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,440
0,330 330,750 750,870 870,960 960,1530
bottom half of the cord.|

144
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,170
0,180 180,360 360,570 570,690 690,810
In this one it would

145
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,310
0,210 210,330 330,540 570,1020 1020,1140
just be this either the

146
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,660
0,360 360,540 540,900 900,990 990,1350
c and g the lowest

147
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,040
0,180 180,660 840,990 990,1200 1200,1380
three strings and just play

148
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,270
0,360 360,480 480,660 660,720 720,1230
those to get you started.|

149
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,870
0,150 150,690 690,810 810,960 960,1020
But ideally we want to

150
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,920
0,390 390,480 480,660 660,720 720,1050
eventually be able to stretch

151
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,820
0,90 90,330 330,540 540,780 780,900
our hands wide enough to

152
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,170
0,180 180,390 420,750 750,1230 1230,1350
get that Ian Etsy and

153
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,360
0,270 330,750 750,1560 1560,1890 1890,2190
they're doing a full c

154
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,060
0,390
chord.|

155
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,060
0,420 510,720 720,960 960,1200 1200,1290
OK the next chord, we

156
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,920
0,390 510,810 810,870 870,1110 1110,1860
learned was A G seventh.|

157
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,250
0,150 150,540 870,1050 1050,1440 1440,1650
We move our fingers up

158
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,690
0,270 270,540 540,780 780,1230 1290,1440
one string set here and

159
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,620
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,660 660,930
down to the first string

160
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,760
0,390 570,810 810,870 870,1020 1020,1140
there so I've got my

161
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,800
0,360 360,900 960,1110 1110,1530 1530,2040
third finger, my second finger

162
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,600
0,360 360,630 630,930 930,1200 1200,1470
open string open string open

163
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,710
0,330 330,480 480,570 570,720 720,1110
string, and then my first

164
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,540
0,510 870,1080 1080,1260 1260,1530 1530,1830
finger on that first string.|

165
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,820
0,300 300,510 510,660 660,930 930,1020
Okay, let's go note for

166
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,360
0,390
note.|

167
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,300
0,60
Yeah.|

168
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,300
0,210 210,360 360,1950
One more time.|

169
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,740
0,240 240,1050
Now altogether.|

170
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,970
0,270 270,330 330,570 570,1020 1020,1380
That's A G seventh chord,

171
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,040
0,570 780,960 960,1020 1020,1140 1140,1230
now if we put them

172
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,850
0,180 180,480 480,600 600,750 750,810
both together we've got to

173
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,160
0,570
see.|

174
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,970
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,720 720,1530
We've got A G seventh.|

175
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,040
0,120 120,210 210,480 480,780 780,870
In the last session, we

176
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,900
0,210 210,540 570,840 840,1440 1650,1860
learned about a minor which

177
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,340
0,120 120,180 180,600 600,930 930,1440
is a five string chord,

178
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,630
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,690 690,960
we don't play that six

179
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,500
0,240 240,360 360,540 540,630 630,870
string it's got an X

180
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,670
0,270 270,420 810,960 960,1050 1050,1170
above it, we have an

181
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,580
0,300 300,1410 1440,2010 2010,2640 2670,2910
open a second finger on

182
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,310
0,210 270,720 810,1860 1860,2220 2220,2730
this e third finger squeezing

183
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,160
0,180 180,570 570,960 2070,2580 2580,2850
up underneath this aeon that

184
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,020
0,510 1050,1410 1410,1680 1680,1770 1770,1860
a first finger on the

185
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,250
0,360 360,480 480,660 660,1020 1020,1230
sea in an open e

186
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,820
0,510
there.|

187
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,540
0,270 360,690 690,1380 1860,2430 2430,2700
That's a minor abbreviation for

188
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,640
0,750
am.|

189
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,600
0,510 1470,1800 1800,2040 2040,2460 2460,2610
Hey, five string cord let's

190
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,100
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,990 990,1500
go through just individual notes

191
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,120
0,840
altogether.|

192
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,690
0,210 210,480 480,1050 1140,1320 1320,1410
Now, Annie chord is the

193
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,490
0,510 510,930 930,1410 1440,1650 1650,1800
same chord form, we just

194
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,630
0,150 150,600 600,750 750,810 810,1140
move everybody up a string

195
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,340
0,360
set.|

196
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,040
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,690 690,870
And it's all use all

197
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
0,300 300,630 630,750 750,870 870,960
six strings on an e

198
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,900
0,420 2730,3210 3210,3750
chord individual notes.|

199
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,100
0,60
Yeah.|

200
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,540
0,210 210,810 2760,3210 3690,3810 3810,4020
All together, now the one

201
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,350
0,150 150,450 450,540 540,630 630,810
new chord that we need

202
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,700
0,90 90,360 360,630 990,1170 1170,1350
to touch on is A

203
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,370
0,330 330,840 840,1260 1620,2340 2340,2670
D minor chord abbreviated d,

204
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,750
0,420 540,840 840,960 960,1080 1080,1380
um, this is our first

205
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,040
0,360 360,720 720,1020 1020,1110 1110,1290
four string cord that we've

206
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,780
0,180 180,750 1050,1410 1410,1620 1620,1740
come across doesn't use all

207
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,130
0,330 330,690 690,810 810,1110 1110,1350
six strings or five strings,

208
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,660
0,180 180,510 510,780 780,1170 1380,1530
this uses just for the

209
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,770
0,300 300,420 420,870 870,1020 1020,1110
first two strings have an

210
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,090
0,240 240,630 690,900 900,1110 1110,1320
x. bio, so don't play

211
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,640
0,420
those.|

212
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,740
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,540 540,900
Then we have an open

213
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,350
0,1380 1410,1950 1950,2310 2310,2460 2460,2610
d second finger on the

0,450 450,780 780,930 930,1170 1170,1650
third finger on that d

215
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,680
0,480 480,840 840,1050 1050,1380 1410,1950
first finger on this f.|

0,1830
Zhu.|

217
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,020
0,240 240,270 270,420 420,810 810,1020
Maybe a little awkward getting

218
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,190
0,210 210,510 510,810 810,990 990,1170
that third finger out there

219
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,970
0,60 60,330 330,540 540,690 690,780
to that d if you

220
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,960
0,210 210,360 360,480 480,630 630,990
want to you could squeeze

221
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,670
0,150 150,270 270,660 660,1050 1260,1710
in your pinky there, but

222
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,360
0,90 90,270 270,420 420,600 600,690
you might get used to

223
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
0,330 330,570 720,900 900,1230 1230,1440
playing it the wrong way

224
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,030
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,600 600,1230
so I would really recommend

225
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,140
0,240 240,480
that you.|

226
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,740
0,420 420,540 540,840 840,1020 1020,1290
Try and stretch that third

227
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,260
0,300 300,510 510,630 630,1290 1290,2520
finger out to {catch's -}

228
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,820
0,1170 1170,2430 2610,2850 2850,3420 3510,4560
a to all together be

229
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,110
0,240 240,660 660,780 780,1020 1020,1290
real careful to only play

230
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,360
0,330 330,1050
for strings.|

231
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,310
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,420 420,750
It's going to get more

232
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,660
0,90 90,240 240,720 720,960 960,1350
and more important, which strings

0,270 270,390 390,510 510,720 720,900
which if I add those

234
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,160
0,270 270,420 420,810 810,1020 1110,3600
extra two strings in I

235
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,080
0,300 300,660 750,1320 1320,1590 1590,1890
get these rumbling down there,

236
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,280
0,450 480,600 600,750 750,810 810,1080
which a lot of guitar

237
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,090
0,270 270,420 420,510 510,660 660,810
players do and it's real

238
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,740
0,570 600,930 930,1230 1230,1380 1380,1650
sloppy doesn't sound too good

239
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,610
0,300 300,420 420,570 570,660 660,750
to make sure we know

240
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,680
0,420 420,990 1020,1320 1320,1650 1650,2070
which chords are five string

0,330 330,510 510,660 660,750 750,990
let's start looking at these

247
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,270
0,600 600,930 930,1200 1200,2100 2400,2820

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,960
0,150 150,390 390,1620
go through foresees.|

0,150 150,300 300,570 570,810 810,930
Then it's four beats of

252
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,080
0,510 690,1410 1410,2070 2370,2640 2640,2880

0,120 120,390 390,570 570,660 660,810
of rest should be no

254
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,160
0,420 420,630 630,810
problem for you.|

the third one you'll notice

273
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,390
0,120 120,390 390,690 690,960 960,1080
we have eighth notes well

274
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,050
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,390 390,660
how do we do eighth

275
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,030
0,210 210,390 390,480 480,1020 1410,1980
notes when we're strumming or

276
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,140
0,300 300,540 540,780 780,990 990,1110
how do eighth notes with

277
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,210
0,540 840,1020 1020,1440 1440,1890 1890,2070
cores, it involves strumming let's

278
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,050
0,180 180,420 420,630 630,750 750,840
talk about that for a

279
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,680
0,360
second.|

280
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,140
0,390 390,540 540,810 810,1110 1110,1290
On my right hand over

281
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,760
0,450 720,990 990,1140 1140,1440 1440,1620
here as I'm coming into

282
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,620
0,270 270,510 510,1050 1260,1560 1560,1860
play this C I come

283
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,940
0,570 750,900 900,960 960,1170 1170,1320
down and I hit my

284
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,990
0,300 300,600 600,840 840,930 930,1050
fifth string, if you can

285
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,800
0,270 270,420 420,570 570,750 750,810
think of, it's kind of

286
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,540
0,300 300,390 390,660 660,1170 1530,1740
making a little arc as

287
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,950
0,120 120,390 390,870 1020,1320 1320,1410
I'm coming around, now, if

288
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,120
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,900
you were a kid.|

289
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,410
0,330 330,690 690,900 900,1020 1020,1050
And somebody gave you a

290
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,730
0,360 360,750 750,930 930,1050 1050,1320
guitar chances are you'd probably

291
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,720
0,240 240,390 390,480 480,630 630,990
walk up to it, go,

292
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,930
0,420 420,900 1620,2250 2310,2580 2580,2970
everybody does now that motion

293
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,040
0,180 180,870
is actually.|

294
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,880
0,540 540,990 990,1080 1080,1290 1290,1410
Pretty close to what you

295
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,660
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,660 660,780
need to be doing, you

296
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,010
0,120 120,210 210,480 630,1110 1110,1350
need to just grip grip

297
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,580
0,60 60,330 330,420 420,540 540,570
a pick in it a

298
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,020
0,150 150,300 300,960 1020,1350 1350,1440
little bit stronger, but you

299
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,520
0,210 210,540 540,1140 1170,1350 1350,1500
want your wrist to be

300
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,620
0,600 990,1140 1140,1290 1290,1860 1890,2100
loosed to be loose, it's

301
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,030
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,1050 1050,1410
almost like you're flicking something

302
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,350
0,210 210,300 300,450 450,810 900,1320
off of your hand, that's

303
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,790
0,300 420,750 750,870 870,1260 1260,1440
the that's the motion with

304
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,750
0,150 150,450 480,720 720,840 840,960
your wrist, if you get

305
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,310
0,120 120,300 300,780 1080,1260 1260,1560
it too tight, it sounds

306
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,870
0,210 210,660 660,780 780,930 930,1560
real choppy and it's not

307
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,590
0,60 60,450 450,510 510,660 660,720
the direction we want to

308
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,670
0,300 480,690 690,810 810,960 960,1080
go to make sure that

309
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,690
0,150 150,420 420,540 540,870 870,1020
your wrist is loose you're

310
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,100
0,300 300,390 390,600 600,1110 1260,1410
gripping the pick strong, but

311
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,360
0,180 180,450 450,540 540,840 840,1260
your wrist is still loose.|

312
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,490
0,330 330,540 540,570 570,750 750,870
Let's take a look at

313
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,810
0,450 600,930 930,990 990,1110 1110,1320
three if I was doing

314
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,580
0,150 150,780 810,1230 1230,1350 1350,1770
that see down and up,

315
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,120
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,390 390,450
we have to do it

316
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,400
0,270 270,390 390,990
nice and steady.|

317
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,500
0,180 180,300 300,540 540,780 780,900
Now I come down with

318
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,520
0,180 180,510 660,780 780,930 930,1020
my art and when I

319
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,130
0,270 270,900 1860,2040 2040,2370 2370,2610
come back I really only

320
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,030
0,150 150,240 240,570 570,690 690,900
hit a couple of them,

321
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,350
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,570 570,750
you don't try to be

322
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,240
0,420 420,630 630,780 1440,1680 1680,1890
accurate on it way back

323
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,230
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,690 690,990
then and then suddenly pull

324
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,100
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,570 570,870

0,120 120,360 360,540 540,690 690,810
it doesn't work that way,

326
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,200
0,150 150,300 300,360 360,750 750,870
just kind of angle, the

327
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,030
0,300 300,420 420,750 960,1380 1380,1830
arc of your arm here

328
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,340
0,150 150,570 690,1170 1170,1470 1470,2190
to go accurate going down.|

329
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,870
0,210 210,540 600,1320 1320,1470 1470,1680
And then you hit some

330
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,180
0,90 90,210 210,540 540,840

Accurate going down some of

332
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,180
0,180 180,510 510,780

378
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,960
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,450 450,690
if you look at your

379
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,150
0,390 390,1050 1140,1470 1470,1890 1890,2130
chord diagram, there's actually two

380
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,260
0,330 330,630 630,810 810,930 930,1110
different ways that you can

0,540 870,990 990,1200 1200,1650 1650,2070
Okay, the more common way

383
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,720
0,150 150,270 270,480 480,570 570,900
is you put your third

0,300 300,510 510,780 780,900 900,960
finger up here on the

385
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,380
0,330 330,840 1650,2190 2190,2550 2550,2700
sixth string, second finger on

386
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,840
0,60 60,420 420,930 1320,2190 2220,2460
the fifth string, then you

387
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,580
0,210 240,810 810,1110 1110,1470 1470,1740
have open string open string

388
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,020
0,360 360,750 750,1080 1080,1200 1200,1440
open string, and then way

389
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,700
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,990 1500,1680
down at the bottom you've

390
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,060
0,210 210,330 330,1110
got your pinky.|

391
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,670
0,240 240,570 720,1230 1230,1950 2040,2250
On that high g on

392
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,600
0,180 210,540 540,690 690,780 780,930

0,240 240,690
first string.|

394
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,250
0,480 840,990 990,1230 1230,1410 1410,1500
Now, the other way of

395
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,020
0,420 420,630 1200,1380 1380,1560 1560,1770
fingering it is just switch

396
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,580
0,90 90,420 420,840 1170,1350 1350,1560
your fingers around I have

397
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,960
0,150 150,660 660,1020 1020,1170 1170,1380
my second finger on that

398
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,760
0,570 780,1290 1290,1560 1560,1710 1710,1800
g first finger on the

399
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,580
0,450 960,1170 1200,1800 1800,2250 2250,2820
b then open open open.|

400
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,420
0,570 570,1380 1590,1770 1770,2010 2010,2280
Third finger on that g

401
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,280
0,420
there.|

402
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,200
0,510 600,960 960,1560 1680,1890 1890,2460
So, either way is right

403
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,070
0,210 210,270 270,420 420,510 510,780
so you need to find

404
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,490
0,210 210,750 1080,2550 2550,2730 2730,3420
which way eyes more comfortable

405
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,980
0,660 660,1230 1440,1590 1590,2100 2340,2490
for you to play and

406
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,940
0,60 60,240 240,510 510,660 660,960
it may be in different

407
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,860
0,360 360,1200 1290,1680 1680,1800 1800,1920
musical situations, one may be

408
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,090
0,210 210,660 660,780 780,900 900,1230
more preferable than the other,

409
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,680
0,270 270,510 510,870 900,1080 1080,1230
the next chord is A

410
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,270
0,270 270,870 990,1290 1290,1380 1380,1590
D seventh back to those

411
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,230
0,240 240,570 570,630 630,780 780,960
d chord so that means

412
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,610
0,90 90,180 180,510 510,870 870,1380
it's a four string cord

413
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,080
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,690 690,1200
I don't play these lower

414
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,420
0,240 240,840
two strings.|

415
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,990
0,330 330,510 510,660 660,750 750,1110
So we have an open

416
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,960
0,1650 1650,2130 2130,2520 2520,2670 2670,2970
d second finger on that

417
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,380
0,570 2280,2790 2790,3090 3090,3210 3210,3420
a first finger on that

418
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,620
0,660
c.|

419
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,020
0,900 900,1560 1830,2070 2070,2280 2280,2550
Third finger on this f

420
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,850
0,600 870,1020 1020,1110 1110,1410 1410,1830
sharp on the first string.|

421
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,300
0,360
MHM.|

422
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,140
0,810 1410,1500 1500,2790 2790,3360
Try one more time.|

423
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,840
0,270 270,1020
Now altogether.|

424
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,160
0,240 240,300 300,450 450,840 900,1140
That's A D seven may

425
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,970
0,120 120,150 150,300 300,630 630,810
be a little tricky getting

426
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,350
0,180 180,450 450,750 750,1110 1110,1380
that third finger underneath there

427
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,520
0,150 150,360 360,510 510,570 570,810
you just kind of try,

428
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,630
0,240 240,480 480,600 600,930 930,1110
it takes a while if

429
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,460
0,150 150,510 510,630 630,1140 1140,1830
your cords are initially buzzy

430
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,750
0,300 300,420 420,630 630,960 960,1200
and you think gosh I'm

431
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,860
0,300 300,510 510,660 660,930 930,1110
never gonna get it just

432
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,280
0,390 1080,1200 1200,1680 1680,2010
sounds it sounds like.|

433
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
0,600 600,840 840,1170 1170,1410
I'm not getting it.|

434
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,480
0,180 180,480 480,600 600,1230 1290,1590
It takes a while I've

435
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,250
0,390 390,570 570,930 930,1200 1200,1770
found in teaching people chords

436
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,450
0,210 210,450 450,780 780,930 930,1140
it takes awhile for them

437
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,560
0,120 120,300 300,480 600,840 840,1110
to get it, some folks

438
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,240
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,870 1230,1680
get it right off and.|

439
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,670
0,270 270,420 420,480 480,720 720,810
It's not a problem of

440
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,020
0,300 300,840 870,960 960,1200 1200,1350
hand strength or anything like

441
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,830
0,210 210,330 330,480 480,600 600,810
that for them, they just

442
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,600
0,180 180,360 720,1140 1140,1590 1620,1770
get it, other folks they

443
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,590
0,150 150,300 300,750 750,840 840,990
have to strengthen up their

444
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,510
0,450 900,1410 1410,1740 1740,1800 1800,1920
hands their problem is they're

445
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,560
0,300 330,630 630,690 690,960 960,1050
not able to push the

446
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,720
0,390 390,720 720,960 960,1890 2070,2160
strings down hard enough to

447
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,490
0,210 210,540 840,1080 1080,1530 1530,1770
get that other folks they

448
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,660
0,240 240,480 480,720 720,810 810,1170
just can't find the sweet

449
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,070
0,360 360,510 510,690 810,1050 1050,1410
spot to it, the chords

450
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,680
0,390
aren't.|

451
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,470
0,660 690,960 960,1080 1080,1440 1440,1590
Buzzy but it's just I

452
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,460
0,210 210,450 450,780 780,930 930,990
got other fingers that are

453
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,840
0,390 390,480 480,840 840,1020 1020,1380
touching the strings all around

454
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,430
0,150 1050,1200 1200,1320 1320,1470 1470,1590
them and I end up

455
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,930
0,120 120,330 330,720 720,1260 1320,1500
with these muted sounds so

456
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,680
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,690 690,750
that's why it's important to

457
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,970
0,300 330,690 690,930 930,1170 1170,1290
go one right after the

458
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,060
0,420
other.|

459
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,010
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,720 720,1200
And you may think gosh

460
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,390
0,270 270,450 450,720 720,870 870,1050
it just sounds like this

461
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,050
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,540 540,660
and it's not gonna get

462
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,640
0,120 120,420 420,870 1230,1440 1440,1590
any better, but I have

463
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,360
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,600 600,720
not found that to be

464
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,010
0,450 570,930 930,1110 1110,1290 1290,1650
true, I've worked with folks

465
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,910
0,90 90,300 300,540 540,600 600,900
with all kinds of different

466
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,930
0,300 300,450 450,660 660,720 720,1020
hands, all kinds of different

467
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,420
0,570 780,1500 1500,1860 1860,2130 2130,2490
fingers, um in in hand

468
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,950
0,360 360,1050 1050,1260 1260,1410 1410,1530
strength issues and I have

469
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,900
0,390 540,780 780,990 990,1560 1650,1950
found that in general they're

470
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,070
0,300 300,390 390,630 630,840 960,1170
able to get it with

471
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,880
0,60 60,210 210,330 330,390 390,810
a little bit of practice

472
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,540
0,90 90,330 330,390 390,600 600,660
it takes a while to

473
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,650
0,210 210,270 270,600 600,960 990,1110
find the sweet spot of

474
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,640
0,150 150,210 210,420 420,510 510,990
where to put your fingers

475
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,560
0,1020 1050,1350 1350,1560 1560,1800 1800,1920
to get it all to

476
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
0,420 420,720 720,1110 1110,1380 1380,1680
sound right but keep working

477
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,410
0,210 210,330 690,840 840,960 960,1170
at it, it may not

478
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,820
0,240 240,300 300,750 750,960 960,1410
come in a few days

479
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,750
0,270 270,360 360,630 630,690 690,870
maybe a week or two

480
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,650
0,330 330,390 390,690 690,810 810,900
before you actually get them

481
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,720
0,90 90,390 390,810 1740,1860 1860,2070
to open up, but once

482
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,410
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,390 390,690
you get them to open

483
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,420
0,420 420,630 630,780 780,1080 1920,2010
up they'll be there the

484
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,160
0,240 240,660 900,1110 1110,1230 1260,1740
next one is an emo

485
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:43,800
0,480
minor.|

486
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,880
0,300 300,870 900,1170 1170,1470 1470,2100
E chord, all six strings,

487
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,530
0,600 600,690 690,780 780,1050 1050,1470
this one is pretty easy,

488
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,180
0,120 120,270 270,570 570,930 1020,1590
we have open e second

489
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,460
0,360 360,510 510,780 780,1230 1740,2280
finger on that be third

490

0,360 360,600 630,1200 1740,1890 1890,1950
finger on e then the

491
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,620
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,870 1470,3210
rest of them open or

492
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:57,880
0,120
open.|

493
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,940
0,60
Yeah.|

494
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,540
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,990 1020,1320
That's an e minor now

495
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,860
0,270 270,630 630,750 750,960 960,1320
be seventh is the last

496
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,280
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,930

On the fifth string five

499
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,460
0,240 240,630 630,810 810,990 990,1140
string cord don't play that

500
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,430
0,300 300,690 1080,1950 2040,2850 2850,2970
sixth string third finger on

501
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,880
0,300 300,570 570,1170 1200,2130 2700,3450
that d sharp third finger

502
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,030
0,120 120,660 660,1470 2340,2760 2760,3150
on that a open b.|

503
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,500
0,180 180,570 570,690 690,840 840,990
And pinky on that f

504
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,330
0,540 540,1380 1380,1530 1530,1710 1710,1830
sharp now this one may

505
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,250
0,210 210,270 270,540 540,1440 1770,1920
take a little practice of

506
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,510
0,240 240,360 360,720 720,840 840,1260
getting them all to sound

507
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,970
0,180 180,810 1830,2190 2190,2400 2400,2460
out clearly a lot of

508
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,960
0,210 210,360 360,600 600,690 690,990
times, you'll find that that

509
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,460
0,180 180,780 810,1110 1110,1290 1290,1500
d sharp won't come out

510
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,290
0,150 150,360 360,660 660,1050 1140,1830
real good, because this finger

511
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,550
0,120 120,450 450,840 870,1110 1110,1230
your second finger, he's got

512
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,690
0,120 120,360 360,630 630,840 840,1140
his little rear end sitting

513
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,890
0,150 150,210 210,540 540,960 960,1200
on the string underneath him

514
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,560
0,240 240,330 330,720
and it doesn't.|

515
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,210
0,90 90,330 330,480 480,570 570,990
It doesn't let him play,

516
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,710
0,150 150,390 390,570 570,720 720,1140
there's really only two problems,

517
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,360
0,180 180,390 390,660 660,1050 1290,1650
why note doesn't sound it's

518
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,290
0,210 210,390 390,630 630,750 750,930
either it doesn't have enough

519
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,880
0,360 360,510 510,690 870,1080 1080,1590
pressure on it or somebody's

520
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,680
0,60 60,150 150,510
in the way.|

521
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,610
0,270 270,1080 1110,1320 1320,1440 1440,1650
So if you've got one

522
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,950
0,330 330,540 540,1230 2100,2220 2220,2340
notes like that and you

523
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,910
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,630 630,960
think you've got enough pressure

524
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,810
0,90 90,300 330,630 630,720 720,900
on it look and see

525
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,610
0,90 90,750 1170,1350 1350,1560 1560,1800
if somebody is not sitting

526
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,450
0,120 120,300 300,600 600,780 780,840
on that note one of

527
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,120
0,120 120,270 270,750 780,2280 2460,2670
your other fingers and that

528
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,140

0,210 210,420 420,720 720,960 960,1440
Here's another five string chord.|

613
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,260
0,1560 1560,2100 2370,2580 2580,2820 2820,3000
Open a and then there's

614
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,280
0,90 90,450 450,600 600,810 810,1020
the tricky thing about this

615
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,690
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,720 750,1410
one as I've got everybody's

616
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,120
0,150 150,330 330,690 690,1080
on that second fret.|

617
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,130
0,180 180,270 270,540 540,750 750,840
On the fourth third and

618
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,510
0,270 270,690 870,1140 1140,1290 1290,1380
second string, so how do

619
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,100
0,90 90,270 270,510 510,1080 1200,1590
we do that well different

620
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,200
0,210 210,360 360,660 660,1110 1470,2100
guys do different ways here's

621
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,820
0,300 300,720 720,1080 1080,1200 1200,1410
what I'll give you two

622
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,930
0,270 270,570 570,720 720,810 810,1110
different ways here's the first

623
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,400
0,270 540,780 780,900 900,1020 1020,1470
way you use your second

624
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,110
0,540 540,720 720,1110 1110,1440 1440,1650
third and first finger and

625
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,490
0,150 150,570 570,1020 1020,1170 1170,1380
you just squeeze them all

626
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,380
0,150 150,570 570,930 960,1470
up underneath there together.|

627
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,510
0,450 750,900 900,1470 1470,1590 1590,1800
Okay, now, sometimes they won't

628
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,800
0,270 270,690 690,840 840,930 930,1290
even fit and so you

629
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,550
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,600 600,750
have to really kind of

630
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,110
0,510 510,600 600,840 840,1110 1110,1200
move your hand around or

631
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,830
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,570 570,720
you may have some of

632
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,720
0,180 180,450 450,660 660,930 1350,1890
that sound like that squeeze

633
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,950
0,180 180,450 450,540 540,720 720,1230
them real in their type.|

634
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,170
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,600 600,840
See if you can't open

635
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,040
0,180 180,330 330,360 360,600 600,870
that up a little bit,

636
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,990
0,480 840,1230 1230,1410 1410,1500 1500,1560
now that's kind of the

637
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,000
0,390 390,510 510,600 600,990 1170,2010
official way to play sometimes

638
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,870
0,90 90,150 150,300 300,360 360,870
in the heat of battle,

639
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,300
0,330 330,870
you may.|

640
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,510
0,450 450,570 570,960 960,1650 1680,1980
Take your first finger and

641
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,700
0,750
bar.|

642
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,720
0,180 180,690 690,780 780,1200 1200,1320
This fourth the third and

643
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,540
0,90 90,660 900,1620
the second string.|

644
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,650
0,450 450,1050 1050,1230 1230,1290 1290,1530
Now a lot of guys

645
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,940
0,180 180,570 570,780 780,990 990,1290
do that there's one problem

646
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,990
0,120 120,510 690,840 840,960 960,1050
with that and it's on

647
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,620
0,90 90,390 390,870
the first string.|

648
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,070
0,270 270,360 360,810 1470,1800 1800,2010
There it is there's no

649
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,590
0,420 420,870 870,1350 1680,2190 2190,2520
way unless you're you're double

650
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,000
0,540 720,930 930,1080 1080,1200 1200,1410
jointed that you can get

651
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,030
0,390 1500,1920 1920,2520 2550,2730 2730,3030
your first finger to bar,

652
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,110
0,180 180,390 390,450 450,900 900,1080
all three of those and

653
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,640
0,270 300,1020 1050,1230 1230,1380 1380,1530
then invert to get off

654
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,700
0,180 180,510 510,900
that last one.|

655
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,800
0,240 240,450 450,690 690,810 810,1740
So it's good when you're

656
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,090
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,660 660,750
on a rare back and

657
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,630
0,180 180,300 300,360 360,450 450,540
just kind of get the

658
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,980
0,330 330,570 570,990 990,1170 1170,1350
bottom four strings of it,

659
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,030
0,210 210,300 300,390 390,540 540,600
but if you want to

660
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,710
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,1050 1560,1680
get the full chord, you

661
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,660
0,240 240,540 570,870 870,1140 1680,1950
really gotta work on getting

662
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,710
0,180 180,480 480,570 570,900 900,1050
these fingers to squeeze all

663
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,480
0,120 120,450 2370,2670 2670,3390
up in a seventh.|

664
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,110
0,180 180,480 480,720 720,900 900,1140
It's pretty easy, we just

665
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,700
0,210 210,720 720,1020 1260,1410 1410,1590
take our a we move

666
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,690
0,120 120,450 450,690 690,900 900,990
our third finger down and

667
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,500
0,180 180,270 270,630 630,750 750,810
take our pinky out of

668
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,180
0,60 60,540 1290,1470 1470,1560 1560,1680
the picture, so we have

669
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,250
0,330 330,810 1020,1530 1530,1950 1950,2070
open a second finger on

670
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,550
0,180 180,480 480,960 2040,2520 2520,3300
that fourth string open g

671
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,420
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,600 600,810
make sure you can hear

672
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,440
0,180 180,450 450,660 660,840 840,1020
that open g make sure

673
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
0,210 210,600 600,900 900,1050 1050,1200
that second finger make sure

674
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,380
0,180 180,450 450,810 1140,1500 1500,1740
his rear end isn't sitting

675
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,100
0,120 120,300 300,810 960,3150 3210,3720
on that string and third

676
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,690
0,300 300,720 720,870 870,1260 1260,1590
finger squeezing up underneath there

677
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,260
0,210 210,390 390,1140
let's see sharp.|

678
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,960
0,150 150,510

Yeah.|

680
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,890
0,300 300,570 930,1050 1050,1290 1290,1410
Very good, the last one

681
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,550
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,510 510,660
we're going to cover is

682
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,680
0,540 930,1320 1320,1620 1620,2010 2010,2130
Annie, all six strings on

683
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,540
0,270 270,540
that e.|

684
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,100
0,210 210,240 240,540 540,690 690,1050
It's a nice, um, excuse

685
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
0,270 720,870 870,1110 1110,1380 1380,1500
me go ahead form it

686

0,210 210,660 660,840 840,1020 1020,1140
by making your e that

687
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,710
0,120 120,390 390,1020 1860,2640 2640,2970
we learned earlier remember that

688
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,030
0,210 210,420 420,600 600,690 690,960
now just take your third

689
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,520
0,300 300,720
finger off.|

690
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,450
0,120 120,210 210,390 390,450 450,690
If we take our third

691
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,290
0,240 240,390 390,480 480,660 660,840
finger off we're just left

692
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,100

Of course getting easier aren't

0,480 570,810 810,1050 1050,1320 1320,1350
OK let's skip down a

718
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,840
0,180 180,450 570,1020 1020,1230 1230,1530

0,720 720,960 960,1080 1080,1410 1410,2040
to let's say number five

720
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,290
0,330 330,480 480,600 600,870 870,960
okay that one starts on

721
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,790
0,120 120,660 780,1140 1140,1230 1230,1500

0,60 60,270 270,390 390,450 450,630
to really get a little

723
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,720
0,180 180,930 960,1650 1740,2370 2580,3300
more complex with the chords.|

724
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,860
0,330 330,660 660,1110 1110,1260 1260,1380
The quarter notes and the

0,300 300,570 570,750 750,810 810,1440
eighth notes of the chords

0,330 330,420 420,510 510,780 780,960
case, you have to pay

727
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,190
0,330 330,390 390,510 510,720 720,780
attention to your rhythm a

728
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,360

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,850
0,180 180,390 390,480 480,600 600,930
we just had a couple

740
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,350
0,90 90,240 240,510 510,750 1290,1500
of them coming up, let's

741
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,580

that number five let's do

743
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,260
0,210 210,450 450,810 1020,1560

0,1260 2730,3330 3330,3450 3450,4020 4620,6000
Rest rest, a minor rest

746
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:32,060

se seventh rest d seventh.|

747
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,060
0,840 1290,3060 3060,3300 3300,3450 3450,3570
Rest now you may have

748
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,590
0,90 90,600 1080,1260 1260,1470 1470,1530
a problem with some of

749
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,910
0,120 120,750 900,1050 1050,1260 1260,1320
your cords, it takes a

750
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,780
0,150 150,270 270,660 660,750 750,870
little bit longer for you

751
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,370
0,180 180,540 540,990 990,1080 1080,1590
to actually form the cord

752
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,180
0,180 180,300 300,390 390,570 570,630
and so you're kind of

753
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,320
0,510 510,570 570,900 900,1020 1020,1140
hesitating in between them, you

754
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,500
0,150 150,450 450,570 570,870 870,3180
may do the first g

755
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,040
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,480 480,540
and then it kind of

756
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,910
0,300 300,360 360,630 630,720 720,870
takes a minute to get

757
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,950
0,240 240,360 360,1740 1740,1860 1860,2040
that e minor, the more

758
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,030
0,60 60,480 480,660 660,750 750,1080
you practice that the quicker

759
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,770
0,150 150,690 690,810 810,1080 1290,1740
that transition will get where

760
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,820
0,120 120,390 390,600 600,960 960,1050
you change those chords is

761
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,990
0,540 540,660 660,750 750,960 960,1170
important and we'll talk about

762
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,830
0,120 120,180 180,240 240,450 450,840
that in the next section.|

763
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,630
0,240 240,330 330,600 600,900 900,1350
For our guitar tips section,

764
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,500
0,150 150,330 330,390 390,570 570,780
we're going to talk about

765
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,270
0,150 150,600 600,1110 1110,1710 1710,1770
two important concepts relating to

766
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,160
0,570 720,1260 1260,1320 1320,1440 1440,1890
chords first of them is

767
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,320
0,570 570,1260 1500,1710 1710,1830 1830,2160
changing chords at the right

768
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,040
0,480
time.|

769
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,620
0,450 450,840 960,1650 1650,1980 1980,2490
This is very very important,

770
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,310
0,30 30,180 180,240 240,540 540,690
a lot of times you're

771
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,560
0,600 600,780 780,1110 1110,1710
practicing these chord changes.|

772
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,300
0,690 690,1080 1080,1440 1440,1710 1710,2130
You're very worried about getting

773
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,950
0,450 450,960 1140,1350 1350,1590 1590,1650
making sure that all of

774
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,910
0,210 210,480 480,540 540,870 870,960
these notes are coming out

775
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,750
0,90 90,180 180,450 450,750 750,840
at the right time and

776
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,160
0,120 120,240 240,630 630,810 1080,1410
that you're playing them enough

777
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,030
0,330 330,420 420,540 540,660 660,870
times and then it's time

778
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,050
0,60 60,240 240,450 450,660 660,1020
to play that next quarter

779
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,860
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,510 510,720
and you've got to think

780
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,550
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,630 630,690
about it there for a

781
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,100
0,450
second.|

782
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,510
0,150 150,840 840,930 930,1140 1140,1440
And then you gotta move

783
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,340
0,660 690,1200 1200,1440 1440,1560 1560,1830
on okay when you're actually

784
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,600
0,270 270,330 330,870
playing a song.|

785
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,110
0,210 210,450 450,690 690,930 930,1290
You gotta keep those chords

786
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,130
0,60 60,150 150,390 390,870 870,1020
in the right spots or

787
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,480
0,90 90,330 330,600 600,990
the song doesn't work.|

788
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,200
0,270 270,510 510,1710 1740,1980 1980,2130
So it's better for you

789
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,970
0,120 120,360 360,1230 1230,1440 1440,1770
to get through and maybe

790
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,960
0,360 360,570 570,630 630,900 900,990
chop off a couple of

791
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,520
0,300 300,480 480,690 690,1050 1050,1560
beats of that first chord

792
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,110
0,240 240,450 450,570 570,1290 1290,1500
in order to land that

793
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,430
0,420 420,810 810,930 930,1050 1050,1320
second court at the right

794
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,020
0,360
time.|

795
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
0,360 360,660 660,750 750,990 990,1440
It's better to do that

796
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,980
0,270 270,720 900,1290 1290,1560 1560,1890
than to catch every last

797
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,360
0,330 330,390 390,630 630,960 960,1380
drop of that first court

798
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,770
0,210 210,510 510,630 630,1020 1020,1380
and Miss the second court,

799
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,320
0,240 240,510 510,840
I'd rather you.|

800
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,630
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,840 840,990
Cut off the first one

801
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,830
0,180 180,540 540,570 570,720 720,1200
give yourself a little time

802
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,000
0,300 300,420 420,600 600,690 690,1050
to get what you need

803
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,900
0,240 240,330 330,600 600,660 660,900
where you need to get

804
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,710
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,510 510,810
so that when it's time

805
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,790
0,90 90,240 240,600 600,930 930,1080
for that second chord, when

806
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,200
0,180 180,450 450,720 720,990 990,1410
that split second comes by.|

807
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,700
0,300 300,540 540,630 630,900 900,990
You're ready to land on

808
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,940
0,150 150,480 480,900
that second corps.|

809
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,940
0,390 450,1140 1140,1680 1680,1800 1800,1890
Okay, changing chords at the

810
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,200
0,360 360,690 690,780 780,1080 1080,1260
proper time is very very

811
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,220
0,450 450,660 660,780 780,840 840,1020
important, next thing I want

812
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,170
0,150 330,600 600,990 1350,1740 1740,1950
to talk about is an

813
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,760
0,180 180,480 480,1080 1290,1440 1440,1590
e minor eleventh now you're

814
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,840
0,270 270,570 630,870 870,990 990,1080

0,180 180,270 270,540 540,1200 1470,1740
through a chord progression, let's

823
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,510
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,720 720,840

0,300 300,450 450,570 570,750 750,1050
Now as you're just starting

829
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,870
0,210 210,300 300,780 810,1080 1080,1200
off in chords, you may

0,150 150,600 600,690 690,960 960,1440
be tempted to do this,

831
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,440
0,450 450,630 630,1200
listen real carefully.|

832
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,580
0,540
Hello.|

833
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,780

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,880
0,540
Okay.|

835
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,120
0,120
Yeah.|

836
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,060
0,540 540,750 750,2700 2970,3180 3180,3390
You hear how you have

837
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,110
0,330 330,480 480,840 840,960 960,1050
right in between when I'm

838
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,090
0,420 420,1080 1110,1410 1410,1740 1740,1980
changing chords I still have

839
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,040
0,510 540,960 960,1470 1590,1860 1860,1950
one strum left and I

840
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,000
0,240 240,450 450,480 480,750 750,960
think well I can't make

841
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,990
0,210 210,450 450,690 690,930 930,990
it and change chords at

842
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,710
0,60 60,270 270,480 480,630 630,720
the right time so I

843
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,240
0,270 270,450 450,660 660,1080 1080,1530
just let that strum go

844
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,560
0,420 420,570 570,990 990,1110 1110,1290
as my fingers are off

845
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,670
0,120 120,420 420,630 630,780 780,1110
the fret board over here

846
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,990
0,210 210,360 360,630 630,810 810,1290
and you end up with.|

847
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,530
0,360 360,660 660,1290 1860,2100 2100,2340
Andy minor eleventh so you

848
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,030
0,120 120,660 810,1050 1050,1320 1320,1500
are not to play any

849
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,650
0,300 300,510 510,720 720,1080 1080,1620
minor level within between chords

850
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,990
0,1080 1080,1350 1350,1740 1740,1980 1980,2250
grab those chords as much

851
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,340
0,150 150,270 270,750 750,1050 1050,1350
as you can hang onto

852
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,300
0,120 120,360 360,660 660,810 810,960
it hang onto it and

853
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,570
0,420 840,1680 2280,2640 2640,2850 2850,3270
then change really really quickly

854
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,550
0,360 360,420 420,750 1170,1380 1380,1680
between the two so that

855
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,800
0,150 150,360 360,480 480,690 690,1140
you don't have that extra.|

856
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,290
0,1050 1260,1530 1530,1530 1530,1890 1890,2220
Superfluous, A E minor eleventh

857
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,190
0,60 60,120 120,300 300,390 390,900
in the middle of everything

858
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,810
0,450 480,690 690,780 780,1050 1080,1500
okay, so if I'm speeding

859
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,830
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,840 840,1020
up a chord progression, maybe

860
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:43,800
0,90 90,240 240,630 2070,2460 2460,5970
I'm doing something I'm sick

861
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,880
0,3210 3210,3300 3300,3660 3660,3870 3870,3990
eyes, A G S E

862
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,690
0,90 90,270 270,660 660,720 720,810
A D seventh in a

863
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,520
0,420 840,1350 1380,1560 1560,1710 1710,1830
gene well just to make

864
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,690
0,210 210,330 330,690 690,1050 1050,1170
sure you're changing course you're

865
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,740
0,210 210,510 510,600 600,780 780,1050
not throwing in that open

866
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,580
0,600
strum.|

867
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,280
0,180 180,270 270,630 630,1050 1050,1260
As you're changing chords which

868
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,880
0,120 120,330 330,570 570,750 750,6600
would sound something like zero

869
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,910
0,1860 1860,2010 2010,2370 2370,2550 2550,2880
eyes are players do just

870
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,740
0,480 630,1200 1200,1650 1650,1740 1740,1830
because we're human and we

871
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,090
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,780 780,1350
like to be sloppy sometimes

872
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,770
0,540 570,870 870,960 960,1230 1230,1380
so try and avoid doing

873
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,880
0,180 180,510 510,720 720,1050 1050,1110
that change, those chords at

874
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,620
0,480 480,570 570,870 870,1230 1500,1740
exactly the proper time so

875
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,150
0,180 180,630 750,930 930,1200 1200,1530
that when the court changed

876
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,350
0,90 90,390 390,480 480,750 750,1200
the song is going by

877
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,400

right chord at the right

00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:20,620
0,360
time.|
