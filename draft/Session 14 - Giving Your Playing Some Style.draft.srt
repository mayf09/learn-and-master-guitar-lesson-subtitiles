0,120 120,480 480,1290 1290,1830 1890,2220
the little nuance things that

a few of them we're

39
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,530
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,660 660,720
going to talk about it

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,640
0,90 90,240 240,600 630,780 780,1110
and go through the proper

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,380
0,450 450,810 900,1260 1260,1470 1470,1740
technique form all these different

42
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,030
0,420 600,990 990,1140 1140,1470 1470,1650
things first thing we're going

43
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,870
0,60 60,300 300,510 510,750 750,840
to start off with and

44
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,190
0,150 150,210 210,300 300,870 870,1320
one of the easiest is

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,500
0,810 810,930 930,1470 1800,2190 2190,2280
sliding to notes man I

46
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,280
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,420 420,780
was it was a long

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
0,150 150,240 240,300 300,600 600,840
one of the first things

48
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,500
0,210 210,840 870,1110 1110,1200 1200,1380
I've discovered that if you

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,670
0,420 420,570 570,720 720,780 780,1170
slide up to a note

50
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,810
0,150 150,330 330,390 390,690 690,1110
it kind of sounds cool,

51
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,970
0,240 240,420 420,840 840,1110 1260,1890
so let's practice that sliding

52
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,040
0,240 240,900
just involves.|

53
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,620
0,180 180,450 450,840 840,1110 1110,1200
You tap whatever note you're

54
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,520
0,300 300,540 540,690 690,810 810,900
going for let's say I'm

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,350
0,270 270,420 420,810 840,1230 1230,1830
going for this fifth string.|

56
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,550
0,150 150,480 480,780 780,1080 1080,1440
Or fifth fret, second string

57
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,170
0,540 1170,1380 1380,1410 1410,1560 1560,1620
e if I want to

58
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,980

0,180 180,600 630,1140 1140,1500 1500,1710
just start somewhere beneath it

60
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,440
0,210 210,360 360,420 420,660 660,720
let's say a half a

61
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,340
0,570
step.|

62
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,450
0,180 180,720 900,1440 1440,1800 1800,1950
And I slide into it

63
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,910
0,180 180,270 270,600 600,1140 1140,1440
so I'm actually playing it

64
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,620
0,210 210,270 270,690 690,1020 1020,1170

0,180 180,540 780,1080 1080,1170 1170,1620
then I keep the pressure

66
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,740
0,180 180,330 330,870 1020,1170 1170,1500

0,600 930,3510 3540,3870 3870,3960 3960,4200
quickly to make it work

70
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,510

0,90 90,660 660,780 780,1020 1020,1140
the slide the line would

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,080
0,150 150,360 360,780
go like this.|

74
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,400
0,180 180,240 240,420 420,510 510,1140
If I do the slide

75
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,170

0,150 150,630 630,1020 1020,1260 1290,1710
that slide change the sound

77
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,350
0,90 90,300 660,930 930,1050 1050,1470
of it one more time

78

0,600 630,660 660,780 780,870 870,1140
If I were to just

91
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,460
0,300 300,420 420,720 720,780 780,1140
play it without the slides

100
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,980
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,630 630,1050
just do the first half

101
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,580
0,2310
bu.|

102
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,860
0,240 240,360 360,540 540,690 690,3720
Hear how that's gonna sound.|

103
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,490
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,420 420,840
And I do the same

104
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,560
0,540 1050,1290 1290,1410 1410,1740 1740,2070
thing putting my third finger

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,760
0,150 150,270 270,840 960,1140 1140,1200
on the g so I've

106
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,630
0,150 150,270 270,480 480,810 810,870
got my hand actually in

107
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,100
0,90 90,480 480,1020 1080,1410 1410,1470
the wrong position, then I

108
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,750
0,570 570,720 720,810 810,1110 1110,1650
slide up to that a

109
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,340
0,270 270,420 420,630 630,900 900,1200
and hit that first finger

110
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,220
0,540
c.|

111
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,770
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,660 660,990
So let's do it together

112
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,840
0,660
slowly.|

113
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,260
0,3150 3150,3240 3240,5850
Goofed your handbag.|

114
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,760
0,240 2250,3750 4080,5310 5310,6540
One time boo boo.|

115
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,030
0,300 300,390 390,510 510,570 570,690
Okay, and if I was

116
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,870
0,210 210,360 360,420 420,750 750,840
playing that in tempo would

117
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,080
0,180 180,270 270,540 540,1290 1290,3210
sound like this, now I

118
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,560
0,120 120,420 420,690 690,1260
can actually keep going.|

119
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,180
0,300 300,450 450,540 540,690 690,780
Just take it up to

120
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,230
0,300 330,540 540,690 690,900 900,1050
take all those things up

121
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:41,170
0,90 90,480 510,1950 5940,6960 8880,8940
in octave, hmm, if I

122
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,970
0,600 600,810 810,1080 1080,1170 1170,1260
was going down and it

123
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,870
0,90 90,180 180,210 210,450 450,900
would be a little trickier,

124
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,830
0,2310 2340,2460 2460,2610 2610,2760 2760,2940
we can only do it

125
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,350
0,210 210,300 300,660 660,990 2580,5280
on the ego down okay

126
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,190
0,180 180,450 450,570 570,660 660,810
now that's it and see

127
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,730
0,120 120,180 180,360 360,420 420,540
if I wanted to do

128
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,110
0,180 180,600 630,990 990,1020 1020,1380
an f with a six

129
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,610
0,360 360,750 960,1140 1140,1320 1320,1500
string root, it's pretty much

130
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,330
0,60 60,390 390,540 540,630 630,720
the same thing we have

131
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,260
0,90 90,300 300,390 390,750 750,930
to just the fingering just

132
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,700
0,90 90,300 300,540 900,1170 1170,1440
a little bit so files

133
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,300
0,60 60,240 240,360 360,420 420,600
an f would be like

134
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,400
0,4290 4320,4500 4500,4560 4560,4770 4770,5100
ziff wanted to keep going,

135
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,610
0,2250 2280,2310 2340,2700 2700,3000 3000,3210
if I can squeeze one

136
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,760
0,210 210,300 300,390 390,690
more out of it.|

137
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:21,280
0,3630
Okay.|

138
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,740
0,300 300,360 360,570 570,720 720,810
It's a good way to

139
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,260
0,210 210,450 450,720 720,1650 1950,2520
get a really large lik

140
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,330
0,300 300,720 750,1440 1590,1770 1770,2040
going from low to high

141
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,010
0,570 750,960 960,1020 1020,1140 1140,1680
notes and you can incorporate

142
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,210
0,180 180,330 330,570 570,1020 1050,1200
that into any key and

143
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,840
0,60 60,150 150,300 300,480 480,630
you can go all over

144
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,100
0,90 90,510 510,690 690,900 900,1260
the neck by just using

145
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,120
0,150 150,300 300,780 810,960 960,1020
that little pattern, one of

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,830
0,120 120,420 420,780 780,1230 1290,1710
my favorite slide patterns, let's

147
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,550
0,90 90,150 150,240 240,450 450,720
go to the next one

148
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,030
0,900 1560,2070 2070,2250 2250,2370 2370,2730
bins, alright there's some Tech

149
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,170
0,270 270,510 510,540 540,780 780,1140
here's all I know about

150
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,820
0,510 720,1230 1230,1410 1410,1470 1470,1650
bends you want to do,

151
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,110
0,210 210,420 420,720 720,780 780,1290
you can bend a note

152
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,610
0,180 180,540 540,900 930,1140 1140,1200
a half step or a

153
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,990
0,270 270,600 600,900 960,1230 1230,1380
whole step up let's talk

154
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,160
0,240 240,330 330,600 600,1020 1020,1170
about the proper technique for

155
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,810
0,330 330,660 780,1140 1140,1260 1260,1650
bends to usually it's involving

156
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,010
0,120 120,570 570,720 720,810 810,1200
the third or the fourth

157
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,640
0,510
finger.|

158
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,620
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,630 630,720
Okay, so let's say I'm

159
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,300
0,150 150,360 360,870 990,1230 1230,1680
on this Li the seventh

160
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,500
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,780 780,1200
fret with my third finger

161
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,340
0,210 210,270 270,390 390,480 480,810
and I want to bend

162
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,400
0,210 210,570 960,1530 1590,2250 2850,3060
that up, OK well we're

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,090
0,270 270,330 330,450 450,510 510,690
here we're going to come

164
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,890
0,360 360,660 660,1200 1200,1590 1590,1800
across another physical problem for

165
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,760
0,180 180,330 330,540 540,600 600,870
it may take a couple

166
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,330
0,60 60,300 300,420 420,480 480,570
of weeks for you to

167
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,490
0,180 180,930 930,1350 1350,1560 1560,2160
get a handle on physically

168
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,170
0,600 600,690 690,780 780,840 840,1230
because we've got to strengthen

169
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,940
0,150 150,480 510,1140 1350,1590 1590,1770
up these fingers I'm gonna

170
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,740
0,510 540,870 870,1080 1080,1350 1350,1800
bend using this third finger

171
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,910
0,240 240,480 480,750 750,1020 1020,1170
bend, this d up to

172
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,760
0,630
Annie.|

173
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,480
0,510 1020,2010 2190,2400 2400,2790 3000,3210
Okay, now I'm not, if

174
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,100
0,90 90,300 300,600 600,3510
I just try it.|

175
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,350
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,570 570,870
You may have to bring

176
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,520
0,210 210,780 780,780 780,1110 1110,1170
this, remember I told you

177
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,300
0,180 180,240 240,420 420,510 510,780
never to bring your wrist

178
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,590
0,270 390,690 690,750 750,990 990,1290
up, here's the one case

179
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,280
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,600 600,690
where you can bring your

180
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,240
0,240 240,630 630,780 780,810 810,960
wrist up get a little

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,650
0,120 120,270 270,660 660,990 1170,1410
bit more pressure there bring

182
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,430
0,150 150,360 360,570 570,690 690,780
that thumb over if you

183
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,020
0,180 180,510 750,1320 1320,1440 1440,1590
need to sometimes if it's

184
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,690
0,270 270,480 1800,2250 2250,2460 2460,2670
hard to bring this note

185
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,830
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,720 780,1140
all the way up use

186
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,780
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,1200 1380,1950
these other two fingers behind

187
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,250
0,330 360,510 510,960 960,1260 1260,1470
him to help bring that

188
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,030
0,330 330,450 450,570 570,660 660,780
string up so you put

189
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,990
0,90 90,390 390,720 720,810 810,960
them all three of them

190
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,520
0,420 600,840 840,1110 1110,1320 1320,1530
down and now bend that

191
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,640
0,330 360,690
note up.|

192
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,040
0,1560
Boo.|

193
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,310
0,180 180,450 450,570 570,990 990,1380
That's using our third finger

194
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,000
0,150 150,210 210,450 450,510 510,660
if I wanted to do

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,890
0,420 630,990 990,1140 1140,1410 1440,1890
one that would be using

196
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,940
0,120 120,480 480,780 780,990 990,1050
my fourth finger, maybe I

197
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,680
0,150 150,450 450,720 720,1200 1200,1740
could go this g here

198
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,430
0,120 120,150 150,330 330,570 570,720
and I could bend him

199
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,000
0,420
up.|

200
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,420
0,510 540,750 750,900 900,1140 1140,1290
Now I can bend up

201
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,830
0,210 210,270 270,600 600,1080 1290,1410
just a half step, let's

202
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,910
0,90 90,270 270,330 330,480 480,1080
go back to my d.|

203
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,350
0,270 270,480 480,630 630,780 780,900
Half step up would be

204
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,610
0,210 210,660 660,1950 1950,3570 3960,4260
e {flat's -} A I

205
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,870
0,150 150,570 570,630 630,930 930,1260
can do a whole note

206
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,120
0,150 150,360 360,2070
a whole step.|

207
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,470
0,930 930,1080 1080,1170 1170,1260 1260,3270
Yeah, that would be a

208
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,390
0,300 300,3090 3510,3990 4050,4440 4440,4530
half step now one of

209
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,590
0,90 90,600 600,750 750,1110 1110,1200
the secrets to bending and

210
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,520
0,60 60,330 330,450 450,630 630,930
I learned this from Larry

211
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,900
0,390 390,540 540,600 600,720 720,1380
carlton one of the greatest

212
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,210
0,540 540,1080 1110,1350 1350,1980 1980,2160
guitar players that incorporates this

213
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,040
0,570
style.|

214
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,800
0,330 330,780
He said.|

215
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,450
0,240 240,420 420,540 540,1050 1200,1800
That when you bend bend

216
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,640
0,480 510,780 780,900 900,1500 1830,2070
up to a pitch don't

217
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,010
0,210 210,630 930,1200 1200,1920 2190,2370
just bend up somewhere, which

218
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,460
0,60 60,210 210,240 240,390 390,450
is what a lot of

219
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,480
0,330 330,630 630,780 780,870 870,1020
guitar players do and they're

220
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,630
0,240 240,270 270,720 720,2880 2970,3150
playing a solo and they

221
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,130
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,840 840,1500
just kind of bend around

222
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,630
0,210 210,450 450,810 1170,1350 1350,1470
and bend up, it's kind

223
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,590
0,60 60,120 120,480 480,750 750,960
of a lazy man's way

224
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,610
0,90 90,330 330,480 720,930 930,1020
of doing it, when you're

225
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,140
0,180 180,630 660,1200 1200,1440 1440,1530
gonna bend bend to a

226
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,730
0,540 840,1110 1110,1140 1140,1350 1350,1590
pitch either a half step

227
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,750
0,210 210,270 270,510 510,810 810,1020
up a whole step up

228
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,920
0,240 240,540 540,570 570,720 720,810
okay takes a little bit

229
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240
0,60 60,120 120,510 840,1140 1140,1320
of a trick a little

230
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,440
0,90 90,150 150,690 690,960 960,1200
bit of control do that,

231
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,310
0,90 90,270 270,360 360,600 600,870
and that's the whole issue

232
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,300
0,870
control.|

233
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,600
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,660 660,1020
Don't just kind of bend

234
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,430
0,540 570,1050 1050,1230 1230,1320 1320,1830
somewhere bend to a pitch

235
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,020
0,390 510,720 720,810 810,990 990,1200
okay so we've talked about

236
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,040
0,240 240,480 480,720 720,840 840,1020
half step bends we've talked

237
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,110
0,180 180,450 450,720 720,1170 1710,2070
about whole step bends now

238
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,430
0,210 210,780 780,1020 1020,1200 1200,1320
let's incorporate those into our

239
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,960
0,300 300,660 660,1290
penta tonic scale.|

240
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,120
0,600 960,1230 1230,1470 1470,1710 1740,1920
Okay so here's our a

241
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,620
0,360 360,600 600,1020 1020,1140 1140,1500
minor penta tonic, a first

242
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,730
0,300 300,510 510,600 600,810 810,1110
form here that we've used

243
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,440
0,240 240,840 990,1380 1380,1620 1620,1710
so often what notes are

244
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,340
0,210 210,270 270,570 570,660 660,900
good to bend in that

245
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,170
0,390 420,480 480,1650 1650,1770 1770,1830
well you don't want to

246
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,130
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,690 690,960
bend on these low notes,

247
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,510
0,60 60,360 780,990 990,1050 1050,1380
it just gets a little

248
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,770
0,570 570,780 780,900 900,1170 1170,1260
bit just to load an

249
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,710
0,270 270,390 390,750 2550,2850 2850,2940
sound real good here's the

250
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,180
0,300 300,450 450,540 540,1020 1020,1470
first one that starts being

251
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,440
0,270 270,360 360,780 930,1110 1110,1260
good to bend I can

252
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,280
0,240 240,390 390,510 510,600 600,840
bend this one a half

253
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,990
0,660 660,1290 1290,1440 1440,1590 1590,1710
step which would get me

254
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,370
0,120 120,210 210,480 480,900 900,1380
to the white flat fifth

255
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,570
0,300 300,390 390,630 630,840 840,960
or I can bend up

256
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,000
0,60 60,330 330,900
a whole step.|

257
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,180
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,600 600,720
Which would get me to

258
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,300
0,90 90,540 630,2250 2250,2250 2430,3120
the {hole's -} a fifth

259
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,420
0,5340 5370,5550 5550,5790 5790,6000 6000,6090
okay so that note is

260
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,590
0,210 210,270 270,660 690,960 960,1170
good to bend either half

261
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,810
0,210 210,270 270,480 480,1830 1950,2220
step or whole step, this

262
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,340
0,480 960,1080 1080,1260 1260,1440 1440,1530
G I can bend it

263
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,060
0,120 120,180 180,390 390,630 630,720
up a whole step and

264
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,360
0,60 60,360 360,690
it sounds great.|

265
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,160
0,1470 1500,2100 2610,2820 2820,2940 2940,3030
Okay I don't want to

266
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,910
0,120 120,300 300,480 480,540 540,750
end up just a half

267
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,250
0,1020 1560,1710 1710,1950 1950,2190 2190,2340
step that doesn't sound too

268
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,790
0,120 120,210 210,390 390,480 480,540
good to get out of

269
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,250
0,60 60,510 1620,1950 1950,2310 2310,2460
the key note also that

270
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,380
0,90 90,270 270,630
I can bend.|

271
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,290
0,480 510,720 720,1080 1080,1260 1260,1620
Is this pinky right here,

272
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,340
0,540 540,630 630,750 750,810 810,990
now you got to kind

273
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,110
0,120 120,480 480,720 750,1050 1050,1770
of play with your fingers

274
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,060
0,330 330,510 510,1050 1230,1530 1530,1920
on that string, what do

275
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,440
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,540 540,1380
you do with your fingernails

276
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,460
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,630 630,1020
and where does the actual

277
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,930
0,360 360,480 480,600 600,900 900,1470
strings that you're coming into

278
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,970
0,240 240,330 330,480 480,960 1620,1740
where do they go do

279
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,130
0,150 150,1560 1710,1860 1860,2010 2010,2160
they go if you can,

280
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,120
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,510 510,990
if you get your fingernails

281
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,870
0,210 210,450 450,600 600,660 660,750
down close enough to the

282
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,980
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,690 690,1110
fret board, you can push

283
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,960
0,240 240,450 450,840 870,1290 1530,1980
those other strings up actually

284
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,300
0,360 360,540 540,1170
over your nail.|

285
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,500
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,690 690,780
And that's one way to

286
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,260
0,180 180,390
do it.|

287
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,910
0,210 210,360 360,810 930,1110 1110,1230
If you've got if you

288
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,740
0,180 180,510 630,1110 1110,1380 1380,1830
go out completely another direction

289
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,490
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,570 570,750
and go at a real

290
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,710
0,570 1290,1440 1440,1680 1680,2070 2070,2220
flat, you just push all

291
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,540
0,150 150,360 360,780 810,1050 1080,1830
those other strings up underneath

292
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,590
0,270 270,420 420,600 600,660 660,780
there's two ways you need

293
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,310
0,60 60,210 210,330 330,420 420,720
to do it, you need

294
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,930
0,270 600,1200 1200,1260 1260,1410 1410,1590
to figure out which way

295
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,520
0,240 240,510 510,600 600,870 1110,1590
works best for you okay

296
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,480
0,150 150,450 450,750 750,870 870,960
so that notes that we

297
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,470
0,150 150,360 360,480 480,720 720,990
can ban a penta tonic

298
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,230
0,510 660,870 870,1050 1050,2430 2520,2760
scale are this one this

299
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,080
0,300 1350,1530 1530,1680 1680,1950 2700,2850
one and this one in

300
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,460
0,180 180,420 420,600 600,930 930,1380
that first penta tonic form.|

301
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,300
0,210 210,300 300,420 420,570 570,810
Right now, the other forms

302
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,620
0,120 120,270 270,570 570,900 1080,1320
would have different notes that

303
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,460
0,210 210,360 360,570 570,720 720,840
those can bend too, but

304
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,330
0,90 90,210 210,330 330,420 420,870
they would be the same

305
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,910
0,510 510,1020 1110,1380 1380,1800 2010,2580
equivalent pitches, the D G

306
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,950
0,150 150,270 600,990 1020,1500 1860,2040
and the and c are

307
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,550
0,60 60,240 240,330 330,450 450,600
the ones that we can

308
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,750
0,330 420,780 780,840 840,930 930,1200
use one of the best

309
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,490
0,660 660,810 810,1110 1110,1530 1590,1740
exercises, you can use to

310
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,840
0,480 480,600 600,990 990,1170 1170,1350
strengthen your hand and all

311
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,270
0,210 210,660 1110,1650 1650,2280 2280,2430
these bends involve strengthening your

312
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,890
0,360 360,840 840,1080 1080,1530 1530,1620
hands, strengthening these fingers, you

313
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,640
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,480 480,750
don't get it, the first

314
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,750
0,330 330,540 540,630 630,780 780,1110
time some of you might

315
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,950
0,210 210,270 270,390 390,720 720,1170
if you have strong hands,

316
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,940
0,300 300,390 390,570 570,720 720,840
but the other ones will

317
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,660
0,150 150,240 240,480 480,630 630,720
have to work on a

318
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,770
0,210 210,450 690,930 930,990 990,1110
little bit has to do

319
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,390
0,120 120,720 720,1200 1200,1500 1500,1620
with string, how thick your

320
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,670
0,510 510,1050 1170,1710 1710,1920 1920,2280
strings are, um, how strong

321
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,780
0,120 120,420 420,720 720,960 960,1110
your hand is that sort

322
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,610
0,60 60,360 570,840 840,1110 1110,1830
of stuff a great exercise

0,360 360,540 540,1170 1530,1560 1560,1770
scale with bins are going

326
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,490
0,60 60,240 240,570 570,1230 1230,1320
to play through solely and

327

0,90 90,180 180,420 420,750 870,1320
then we'll talk about him,

328
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,400
0,780 840,1230 1230,1320 1320,1440 1440,1590
C D and then we

Then I have to stick

331
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,990

0,390 390,540 540,780 780,1050 1050,1110
format is really easy to

340
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,420
0,540 540,720 720,840 840,1020 1020,1290

it's a little bit different

343
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,140

0,60 60,2730 2730,2850 2850,3090 3090,3180
So let's go down one

351
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,800
0,90 90,510 540,1350 1500,1680 1680,1830
more time c then from

352

0,60 60,120 120,600 600,660 660,2220
it in context it would

357
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,270
0,330 3930,5910 5940,7020 7020,7380 7380,7470
be a good exercise to

to do the bins that

360
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,540
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,930 930,1140
you need and incorporate those

we want to talk about

363
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,950

0,780
my.|

383
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,330

it actually sounds out the

385
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,020
0,360 390,1590 1590,1650 1650,1770 1770,1980
gi think of it like

386
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,010

0,90 90,180 180,330 330,510 510,780
if you ever looked inside

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,720
0,420 450,750 750,840 840,1170 1170,1620
finger first to third finger

399
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,190
0,330 330,420 420,720 720,1110 1170,1440
first to fourth finger, so

400
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,570
0,180 180,360 360,450 450,720 930,1380
let's look at our hammer

401
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,640
0,180 180,1020 1230,1440 1440,1800 1800,2070
on exercise, the first one

402
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,660
0,240 240,390 390,660 660,870 870,990
goes from like e to

403
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,520
0,540
f.|

404
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,840
0,1350
I'm.|

405
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,660
0,1440
Boo.|

406
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,340
0,1830 1860,2040 2040,2160 2160,2340 2340,2670
Trying to get that second

407
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,330
0,180 180,270 270,690 690,810 810,990
note to sound out, keep

408
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,410
0,180 180,510 510,630 630,810 810,1080
that pressure on you really

409
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,370
0,120 120,240 240,540 540,630 630,960
have to whack it against

410
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,110
0,210 420,840 840,1140 1230,1530 1530,1740
that fret board, let's go

411
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,400
0,270 330,510 510,780 780,1200 1200,1290
from E F sharp or

412
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,720
0,300 300,390 390,870
one to three.|

413
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,280
0,1440
Boo.|

414
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,600
0,1470
Bang.|

415
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,580
0,180 180,540 540,1230 1320,3300
What about e.g. xii.|

416
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,720
0,1950
Wonderful.|

417
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,500
0,540 810,1020 1020,1110 1110,1200 1200,1530
Okay try it on different

418
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,210
0,570 600,960 960,1050 1050,1230 1230,1710
strings try it on different

419
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,340
0,420 420,690 900,1110 1110,1380 1380,1680
places on the fret board

420
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,120
0,330 330,360 360,510 510,600 600,660
takes a little bit of

421
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,530
0,360 360,450 450,630 630,1200 1230,1410
muscle in that pinkie to

422
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,820
0,180 180,270 270,720 720,900 900,1290
get to hammer on strong

423
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,600
0,210 210,330 330,540 540,660 660,780
enough but that's what you're

424
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,680
0,270 270,480 480,600 600,780 780,1080
going for you want both

425
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,210
0,210 210,300 300,600 600,1050 1110,1530
notes to actually sound pretty

426
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,050
0,570 2880,3120 3120,3270 3270,3450 3450,3840
similar now let's talk about

427
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,730
0,330 360,660 660,870 870,930 930,1200
the flip side of hammer

428
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,900
0,180 180,360 360,450 450,780 780,1170
ons which is pull offs

429
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,240
0,630 630,1050
pull offs.|

430
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,030
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,660 660,840
Let's say I'm going from

431
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,200
0,210 210,840 870,1020 1020,1050 1050,1170
this g and I want

432
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,920
0,60 60,180 180,420 420,480 480,720
to get back to this

433
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,870
0,390 390,1020 1020,1440 1440,1530 1530,1920
ear without picking the note

434
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,280
0,420 420,480 480,750 750,840 840,1020
instead of picking it like

435
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,840
0,300 660,900 900,1080 1080,1200 1200,1560
that I have my finger

436
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,430
0,120 120,450 600,1200 1260,1470 1470,1590
on this g and I'm

437
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,620
0,180 180,660 660,1350 1770,2010 2010,2190
gonna pull down I got

438
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,550
0,60 60,330 330,390 390,810 810,930
a lot of pressure on

439
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,250
0,210 210,660 2130,2310 2310,2400 2400,2700
this e and I pull

440
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,930
0,210 210,480 480,960 960,1170 1170,1680
down and release that string.|

441
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,580
0,210 210,330 330,570 570,810 810,1230
So I'm doing two things,

442
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,600
0,210 210,390 390,480 480,570 570,1020
not only am I pulling

443
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,100
0,300 300,420 420,600 600,1110 1170,1500
down with this string, I'm

444
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,110
0,270 270,570 570,990 990,1590 1770,2010
also giving counter pressure with

445
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,550
0,240 240,750 870,1110 1110,1290 1290,1440
this finger not only I'm

446
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,540
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,720 720,990
pulling down with this finger

447
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,500
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,660 660,960
but I'm giving counter pressure

448
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,790
0,90 90,360 510,930 930,1080 1080,1290
with this finger, so one

449
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,900
0,300 300,510 510,720 720,870 870,1110
fingers going down one {finger's

450
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,140
0,60 60,330 330,630
-} going up.|

451
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,920
0,1440 1470,1620 1620,1740 1740,1860 1860,2100
I do with my third

452
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,330
0,2250 2520,4080 4080,4170 4170,4290 4290,4410
finger practice it with your

453
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,540
0,300 300,750
second finger.|

454
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,060
0,1620 1650,2370
Third finger.|

455
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,210
0,30 120,4260 4260,4410 4410,4620 4620,4800
I can now I can

456
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,500
0,480 480,660 660,780 780,810 810,1290
combine those with a hammer

457
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,280
0,510
on.|

458
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,650
0,300 300,630 630,720 720,900 900,1020
I hammer on one way

459
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,310
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,540 540,660
and then pull off the

460
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,580
0,330 360,1440 2400,2730 2730,3030 3030,3270
other I'm only actually hitting

461
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,020
0,450 450,750 750,900 900,1020 1020,1440
one note with my pick

462
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,950
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,480 480,600
and the rest of it,

463
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,510
0,120 120,450 450,510 510,720 720,4560
my fingers are doing z

464
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:09,560
0,4440 4710,5010 5010,5640 5640,5940 5940,6090
okay, so incorporating hammer ons

465
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,340
0,120 120,330 330,510 510,660 660,780
and pull offs into your

466
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,990
0,360 360,750 780,1320 1320,1440 1440,1650
playing now hammer on let's

467
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,610
0,180 180,360 360,600 600,1170 1170,1620
talk about one specific technique

468
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,300
0,120 120,210 210,390 390,450 450,690
that we need to work

469
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,490
0,300 450,1080 1080,1560 1590,2010 2010,2190
on with a hammer ons

470
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,020
0,120 120,390 390,750 960,1410 1410,1530
and pull offs that would

471
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,160
0,150 150,270 270,660 660,840 840,1140
be the old eddie Van

472
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,200
0,570 900,1200 1200,1320 1320,1950
halen type of tapping.|

473
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,770
0,480 1080,1560 1560,1620 1620,1890 1890,2220
OK bunch of different skills

474
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,270
0,450 450,570 570,750 750,1020 1110,1500
involved with this one, let

475
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,790
0,630 1200,1500 1500,1560 1560,2010 2010,2520
me do it without distortion

476
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,480
0,300 300,390 390,480 480,570 570,690
first, then I'll do it

477
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,800
0,150 150,750 900,1170 1170,1260 1260,1320
with distortion, let's say I'm

478
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,090
0,180 180,390 390,600 630,1080 1080,1290
going between this Ian this

479
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,040
0,630
g.|

480
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,220
0,150 150,270 270,480 480,630 630,840
And I'm also gonna come

481
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,120
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,570 570,900
over here with my first

482
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,670
0,600 1380,1560 1560,1770 1770,2100 2100,2550
finger and hit this a

483
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,830
0,210 210,270 270,600 900,1260 1260,1590
so I got three things

484
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,060
0,270 270,360 360,510 510,630 630,1230
going I got the e.

485
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,420
0,930
g.|

486
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,080
0,570
A.|

487
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,370
0,600 690,870 870,1140 1140,1320 1320,1500
Now I'm not eddie Van

488
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,660
0,330 330,480 480,960 960,1170 1170,1290
halen but basically here's the

489
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,910
0,450 600,870 870,1050 1050,1680 2010,2250
deal on that concept you

490
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,330
0,210 210,270 270,2790 2790,2820 2850,3420
kind of {start's -} pull

491
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:58,090
0,330 4710,4950 4950,5160 5160,5520 5520,5760
off with this finger, I'm

492
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,440
0,300 300,480 480,600 600,1080 1080,1320
actually kind of tugging down

493
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,250
0,60 60,210 210,360 360,420 420,810
a little bit of a

494
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,360
0,300 300,510 510,690 690,870 870,1110
pull off with my other

495
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:10,570
0,480 2340,8250 8280,8520 8520,8970 8970,9210
finger, okay, that's basically it

496
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,220
0,240 240,510 510,930 930,1140 1140,1590
now gets infinitely more complex

497
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,750
0,120 120,420 480,780 780,1020 1020,1530
than that, but that's basically

498
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,520
0,540 540,1020 1020,1170 1170,1410 1410,1770
the technique that's being used

499
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,920
0,630 630,720 720,900 900,1650 1770,2310
throw a little distortion, little

500
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,990
0,750 1020,1380 1380,1470 1470,1680 1680,2070
delay crank it up solo

501
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,100
0,240 240,330 330,630 630,840 840,1110
rock and {roll {-} -}

502
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:31,000
0,3600 3600,3630 4380,6900 6900,6960 6960,7350
with it's a zat's basically

503
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,890
0,180 180,390 390,840 840,1170 1320,1890
what that technique is now.|

504
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,170
0,480 480,660 660,840 840,930 930,1080
Another thing if I want

505
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,460
0,60 60,630 630,990 990,1170 1170,1290
to incorporate hammer ons and

506
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,420
0,210 210,390 390,540 540,690 690,960
pull offs into my pana

507
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,520
0,300 300,960 1590,1920 1920,1950 1950,2100
tonic scale, well I can

508
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,970
0,330 330,540 540,660 660,960 990,3450
go something like this, I'm

509
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,190
0,630 630,1440 1440,1530 1530,1980 1980,2190
actually hitting the first one

510
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,600
0,120 120,300 300,660
of each pair.|

511
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:54,390
0,3390 5640,6210 6210,6480 6480,6630 6630,6720
Ben sometimes hammer ons and

512
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,260
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,510 510,870
pull offs are a great

513
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,950
0,150 150,240 240,420 420,480 480,690
way to get a lot

514
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,810
0,60 60,780 810,1290 1290,1650 1650,1860
of speed without actually having

515
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,750
0,90 90,390 390,510 510,810 1380,2940
to pick it all to

516
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:14,010
0,2010 3690,9270 11850,12600 12600,12810 12810,13230
all za sounds really impressive

517
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,120
0,330 330,540 540,630 630,870 870,1110
sounds like I'm going really

518
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,850
0,480 630,1140 1140,2070 2280,2610 2610,2730
fast actually I'm I guess

519
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,870
0,120 120,510 510,630 630,840 840,1020
my fingers on this and

520
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,590
0,30 30,240 240,360 360,420 420,720
are doing all the work

521
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,940
0,240 240,450 450,690 690,990 1080,1350
but not this hand I'm

522
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,380
0,270 270,660 690,1110 1110,1290 1290,1440
using all hammer ons and

523
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,090
0,270 270,600 750,1020 1020,1440 1440,1710
pull offs, so practice doing

524
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,380
0,450 450,780 780,990 990,1110 1110,1290
scales practice doing our pen

525
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,030
0,390 390,780 780,930 930,1440 1440,1650
atomic scales with those and

526
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,830
0,570 570,780 840,1350 1350,1650 1650,1800
hammering and hammering on and

527
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,640
0,300 300,450 450,720
pulling them off.|

528
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,390
0,390 480,720 720,810 810,1020 1020,1140
Okay, okay, the next thing

529
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,110
0,30 30,150 150,210 210,390 390,720
I want to talk about

530
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,090
0,240 240,840 840,1050 1050,1170 1170,1800
is muting with our palm

531
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,710
0,390 390,750 750,1230 1230,1350 1350,1590
very common technique I did

532
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,940
0,480 480,660 660,840 840,1020 1020,1230
a little bit when we.|

533
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,590
0,180 180,270 270,420 420,540 540,1050
When we had our welcome

534
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,150
0,510 510,690 690,810 810,1290 1290,1410
part little bit earlier, and

535
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,750
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,480 480,600
that was the thing that

536
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,970
0,90 90,450 690,1380 1410,1800 1800,2220
I did using palm muting

537
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
0,120 120,450 450,720 720,900 900,960
I'm taking this part of

538
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,010
0,60 60,540 540,810 810,900 900,1050
the fleshy part of my

539
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,020
0,660 990,1200 1200,1320 1320,1620 1620,2010
palm on my right hand.|

540
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,690
0,330 330,570 570,840 840,1050 1050,1140
Putting it right at the

541
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,140
0,390 390,690 690,1110
bridge down here.|

542
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,340
0,210 210,330 330,630 660,960 960,990
And then I'm playing a

543
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,180
0,240 240,390 390,510 510,630 630,840
note let's say I'm playing

544
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,900
0,120 120,360 360,540 540,630 630,720
an a here at the

545
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,680
0,420 420,810
seventh fret.|

546
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,270
0,570 1950,2580 2640,2820 2820,2910 2910,3060
Okay, now if I put

547
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,410
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,660 660,1140
it too far back, it

548
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,550
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,540 540,1140
just sounds like a regular

549
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,510
0,420 420,660 660,750 750,840 840,930
string but put it too

550
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,790
0,240 240,750 1650,2040 2040,2220 2220,2280
far up it kind of

551
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,720
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,840 840,930
gets this funny sounds it

552
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,440
0,210 210,270 270,420 420,630 630,720
takes a little while to

553
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,480
0,300 300,1260 1260,1590 1590,1950 1950,2040
figure out getting just the

554
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,470
0,390 390,690 690,810 810,870 870,990
sweet spot where you can

555
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,190
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,660 660,720
hear where it's supposed to

556
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:15,410
0,270 3840,4260 4260,4650 4650,4860 4860,5220
be my major penta tonic

557
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,490
0,60 60,420 420,630 630,900 900,1080
a minor penta tonic scale,

558
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,080
0,240 240,480 480,780 780,810 810,960
it lends itself a little

559
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,610
0,90 120,570 570,870 870,1170 1170,1530
bit easier doing all down

560
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,050
0,540 630,930 930,1050 1050,1320 1320,1440
strokes rather than down than

561
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,420
0,180 180,360 360,570 570,630 630,2370
up, it's hard to do

562
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,170
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,540 540,690
I guess you can do

563
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,340
0,300 300,420 420,660 660,840 840,1170
UPS but it lends itself

564
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,600
0,60 60,180 180,510 600,990 990,1260
a bit better doing down

565
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,680
0,330 330,420 420,630 780,990 990,1080
strokes on that so I'm

566
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,360
0,540
practicing.|

567
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,590
0,420 420,540 540,750 750,870 870,990
Practice on that, you get

568
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,030
0,180 180,390 390,1020 1020,1350 1350,1440
this hand straight put it

569
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,290
0,120 120,270 270,750 780,990 990,1260
on that bridge a little

570
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:45,910
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,5910 7260,7620
bit up from zero OK

571
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,870
0,300 300,420 420,570 570,690 690,870
now if I'm in let's

572
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,700
0,210 210,450 450,1050 1350,1560 1560,1830
say a minor a minor

573
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,560
0,540 690,1140 1140,1230 1230,1740 1740,1860
chord, remember our triads is

574
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,820
0,210 210,360 360,480 480,600 1140,1260
built up of an A

575
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,540
0,630 660,900 930,1470
C and e.|

576
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,680
0,450 750,1290 1290,1470 1470,1620 1620,1740
Okay, if I'm in a

577
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,650
0,270 270,870 1170,1770 1770,2310 2310,2970
minor seventh ba ce energy,

578
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,270
0,270 270,420 420,600 600,990 1080,1230
now I can take I

579
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,870
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,480 480,600
don't want to play an

580
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,040
0,120 120,420 420,810 810,900 900,1170
a minor seven the whole

581
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,730
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,630 630,690
time, if I want to

582
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:10,620
0,120 120,3030 3060,6870 7260,7650 7710,7890
have a zat well that's

583
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,790
0,120 120,360 360,780 780,930 930,1170
not very interesting, if I'm

584
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,140
0,300 300,420 420,630 630,1170 1170,1350
doing a rhythm accompaniment with

585
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,830
0,150 240,480 480,510 510,630 630,690
it, so a lot of

586
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,610
0,240 240,300 300,420 420,600 600,780
times I can just take

587
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,350
0,480 480,930 960,1080 1080,1320 1320,1740
certain notes of that chord

588
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,000
0,450 450,720 720,1050 1050,1260 1260,1440
dual pol muting with it

589
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,920
0,240 240,390 390,570 570,1290 1290,1830
and I end up making

590
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,390
0,150 150,510 510,690 690,780 1050,1470
some music with it, OK

591
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,590
0,330 330,390 390,660 660,840 840,1020
take a listen to CEO

592
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,020
0,270
here.|

593
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:34,210
0,570 570,810 810,1050 1050,4020 6780,7980
I'm just using z me

594
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:44,260
0,0 750,2190 9510,9750 9750,9960 9960,10050
a ga me throw the

595
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,250
0,270 270,360 390,600 600,720 720,990
c and e in there

596
00:19:45,250 --> 00:20:05,760
0,300 1800,5850
to zen.|

597
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,230
0,120 120,180 180,240 240,450 450,810
One of the most helpful

598
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,060
0,450 450,600 600,870 870,1290 1530,1830
techniques I've ever learned is

599
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,380
0,240 240,600 600,990
that palm muting.|

600
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,870
0,420 420,630 630,870 870,960 960,1140
Folks, some folks will put

601
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,680
0,90 90,120 120,570 600,690 690,810
up a song I don't

602
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,490
0,60 60,450 480,600 600,690 690,810
know whether I don't know

603
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,140
0,510 690,960 960,1050 1050,1320 1320,1650
anything, what the chord changes

604
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,100
0,240 240,540 540,660 660,900 900,960
are anything I'm supposed to

605
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,990
0,180 180,510 510,1080 1410,1680 1680,1890
play something fabulous, you just

606
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,220
0,180 180,540 540,750 750,960 960,1230
take whatever key you're in

607
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,540
0,210 210,420 420,600 660,1170 1170,1230
I play the root of

608
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,280
0,330 450,1080 1230,1380 1380,1530 1530,1740
that key and I've got

609
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,420
0,60 60,240 240,390 390,540 540,1140
it let's say, um, see

610
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,400
0,780 4440,4680 4680,4770 4770,4890 4890,4950
I don't know what the

611
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,300
0,240 240,570 570,780 780,810 810,900
chord changes are I don't

612
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,710
0,120 120,660 690,960 960,1140 1140,1410
know anything I just I

613
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,910
0,150 150,450 450,540 540,720 720,1200
just vamp on that c

614
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:39,720
0,150 150,240 240,570 570,2580 6540,6750
and it sounds hip through

615
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,240
0,4290 4290,4590 4590,4890 4890,5310 5310,5520
a couple notes around it.|

616
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,890
0,150 150,360 360,510 510,600 600,870
And yeah you can still

617
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,240
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,1050 1050,1350
work, you've got a good

618
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,830
0,600 690,1170 1170,1350 1350,1440 1440,1590
funky guitar part that you

619
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,060
0,90 90,480 510,810 810,1020 1020,1230
can play your not just

620
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,140
0,360 360,510 510,570 570,960 960,1080
hammering out the chords which

621
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,040
0,90 90,240 240,420 420,570 570,900
is what every other guitar

622
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,820
0,210 210,330 330,480 480,600 600,780
player would do you've got

623
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,110
0,270 270,720 750,1020 1020,1230 1230,1290
something unique and all of

624
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,250
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,750 750,1140
this is you're just taking

625
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,390
0,240 240,450 450,510 510,600 600,1050
the root of the chord

626
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,040
0,90 90,210 210,540 540,1200 1290,1620
or the fifth sometimes do

627
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,150
0,60 60,270 270,540 540,900 900,1110
a little palm muting come

628
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,960
0,180 180,300 300,330 330,540 540,810
up with a little rhythm

629
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,100
0,210 210,390 660,780 780,990 990,1140
with it and that's all

630
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,840
0,210 210,510 660,1080 1080,1350 1350,1740
that is okay, another technique

631
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,500
0,30 30,150 150,210 210,420 420,660
I want to show you

632
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,780
0,300 300,960 1230,1650 1650,1800 1800,2250
is picking while you're picking.|

633
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,850
0,540 810,1020 1020,1440 1440,2160 2490,2700
Putting my second finger, the

634
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,350
0,660 750,1110 1110,1320 1320,1440 1440,1500
nail just down on the

635
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,490
0,300 300,600 600,930 930,1020 1020,1140
string just setting it on

636
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,960
0,90 90,540 570,900 900,1080 1080,1470
the string while I'm playing

637
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,890
0,240 240,420 420,630 630,780 780,900
it gets this little bit

638
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,720
0,60 60,180 180,810 810,1350 1500,1830
of a harmonic happening and

639
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,100
0,180 180,570 600,840 840,1230 1230,1380
it's real real cool real

640
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,240
0,300 300,660 660,780 780,900 900,1140
common sound, so if I'm

641
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,110
0,270 270,420 420,570 570,630 630,870
playing let's say A C

642
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:25,390
0,270 270,1500 4710,4980 4980,5100 5100,5280
major scale, now I'm just

643
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,830
0,120 120,450 450,690 720,1170 1170,1440
gonna set my second finger

644
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,730
0,300 300,480 480,690 690,750 750,900
nail on top of those

645
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:35,950
0,270 270,840 6390,7230 7680,7890 7890,8220
strings as you hear how

646
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,330
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,840 840,1260
it doesn't come out perfect

647
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,260
0,120 120,210 210,480 480,570 570,930
all the time, but sometimes

648
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,940
0,60 60,210 210,960 990,1620 1620,1680
it gets a squeal eee

649
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,680
0,510 510,600 600,690 690,3090 3120,4740
harmonic way at zero okay

650
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,900
0,2070 2130,2280 2280,2490 2490,3000 3000,3570
okay a little distortion on

651
00:21:50,920 --> 00:22:02,500
0,6930 7980,8820 10410,11190 11190,11430 11430,11580
za, you're harmonic way up

652
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,420
0,390 480,1050 1050,1260 1260,1590 1590,1920
there that's all coming from

653
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,000
0,360 360,540 540,960 960,1470 1860,2460
using that second finger nail

654
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,300
0,150 150,240
on that.|

655
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,680
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,750 750,1110
It takes a little practice

656
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,340
0,120 120,270 270,330 330,570 570,660
to get it down, but

657
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,300
0,210 210,330 330,510 510,630 690,960
once you get it, it's

658
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,400
0,120 120,330 330,690 900,1980 1980,2100
a real hip effect that

659
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,120
0,90 90,210 210,420 420,570 570,720
you can put into your

660
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,500
0,420 780,1080 1080,1200 1200,1260 1260,1380
playing last thing I want

661
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,120
0,60 60,240 240,570 660,870 870,1620
to talk about is octaves

662
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,260
0,360 360,540 540,660 660,900 900,1110
let's say I'm playing a

663
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,670
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,600 600,1050
guy puts up a song

664
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,810
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,570 570,990
and I'm supposed to sound

665
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,720
0,900 1230,1740 1890,2340 2370,2550 2550,2700
jazzy okay, well I can

666
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,000
0,300 300,510 510,1230 1380,1710 1710,2280
play in octaves now octaves

667
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,140
0,120 120,210 210,510 510,1020 1020,1140
in our music notation, if

668
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,890
0,120 120,330 330,390 390,630 630,750
I'm playing A C that

669
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,940
0,90 90,180 180,270 270,540 540,1050
would be a low c

670
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,680
0,330 330,420 420,690 690,1020 1020,1350
and a high c plate

671
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,070
0,210 210,270 270,600 600,1140 1170,3390
at the same time, okay

672
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,480
0,180 180,300 300,690 690,930 930,1380
how it fingers, well best

673
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,040
0,270 270,390 390,810 810,1170 1170,1350
how it fingers best on

674
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,900
0,750
guitar.|

675
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,660
0,660 690,960 960,1080 1080,1590 2190,2490
So if I use one

676
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,800
0,120 120,750
and three.|

677
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,190
0,1410 1440,1680 1680,1770 1770,1860 1860,2130
Now, how do I play

678
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,970
0,300 300,510 510,600 600,720 720,780
those because I've got a

679
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,340
0,300 300,360 360,780 780,1380 1800,2370
string in between, without getting

680
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,330
0,180 180,450 450,540 540,840 840,990
that string to sound well

681
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,500
0,300 300,480 480,750 780,960 960,1170
actually got my I play

682
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,820
0,120 120,300 300,360 360,930 1110,1320
it kind of sloppy and

683
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,750
0,60 60,270 270,390 390,690 690,930
I put my first finger

684
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,480
0,1110 1770,1980 1980,2130 2130,2340 2340,2730
down on that middle string

685
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,340
0,240 240,750 1140,1380 1380,1500 1500,1770
so actually what you're hearing

686
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,060
0,210 240,2700 2730,2970 2970,3480 3480,3720
is you're hearing that dead

687
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,120
0,240 240,330 330,780 870,2220 2640,3060
string in between them, when

688
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,900
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,420 420,780
I play it all together

689
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,630
0,210 210,1380 1380,1680 1680,1800 1800,2730
but it doesn't come out

690
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,460
0,30 60,1560 1560,1680 1680,1740 1740,1830
I can do it on

691
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,670
0,60 60,360 360,810 1380,1980 2040,3210
the six string I can

692
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,460
0,330 330,600 600,900 900,1410 2490,2760
use one for perhaps one

693
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,450
0,360 390,3540 3570,3750 3750,3810 3810,3990

702
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:35,650
0,330 330,7860 8040,9750 9750,10140 10140,10350
stretch for a it takes

703
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,880

710
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,060
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,1020 1080,1320
he used his thumb for

711
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,200
0,180 180,570 570,810 810,1050 1050,1140

752
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,890

757
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,650
0,180 180,330 330,420 420,750 750,870
Let's say the song is

758
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,690
0,240 360,660 660,1260 1410,1560 1560,2040

0,690 810,960 960,1380 2070,2400 2400,2520
problem, you find let's say

761
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,540
0,90 90,420 420,480 480,1050 1080,3480
the chords are D G

762
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,680
0,120 150,750
and a.|

763
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,020
0,180 180,360 360,510 510,570 570,750
But they want to do

764
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,650
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,420 420,630
it, they want to take

765
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,640
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,690 690,990
it up, the key and

766
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,660
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,570 570,1020
do it in a flat,

767
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,500
0,390 420,690 690,1350
well no problem.|

768
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,980
0,120 120,510 510,1020 1020,1650 2040,2220
The distance between d and

769
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,200
0,270 270,810
e flat.|

770
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,070
0,90 90,330 330,420 420,480 480,660
The key that I know

771
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,110
0,120 120,570 570,840 1410,1860 1890,2040
my chords in and the

772
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,250
0,330 330,480 480,600 600,960 960,1140
flat where we're going is

773
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,620
0,270 270,600 600,1050
one half step.|

774
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,350
0,240 240,330 330,540 540,930 930,1200
Which is one frets worth

775
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,070
0,90 90,150 150,540 540,660 660,720
on the guitar, so I

776
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,960
0,210 210,600 990,1320 1320,1320 1740,1890
put my cape oh at

777
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,820
0,120 120,480 480,990 1350,1650 1650,1860
the first fret and now

778
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,590
0,180 180,630 840,1050 1050,1290 1290,1770
I've got my d chord

779
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,120
0,1230 1230,1800 1890,2790 2790,3420 3420,4530
xii chord a chord, but

780
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,840
0,180 180,270 270,420 420,630 630,720
now I can play it

781
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,620
0,90 90,150 150,450 450,600 600,780
in a different key so

782
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,210
0,300 300,570 570,690 690,1320 1320,1590
I'm playing A D but

783
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,710
0,150 150,480 480,1050 1050,1170 1170,1500
it's actually sounding as Annie

784
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:26,300
0,570 4890,6750 6750,6750 6750,7350 7440,7590
{flat's -} a guitar I

785
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,110
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,720 720,810
can go even more than

786
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,130
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,570 570,1020
that, let's say I wanted

787
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,500
0,870 990,1260 1260,1470 1470,1740 1740,2070
to do my d chord

788
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,070
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,390 390,570
but we're going to use

789
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,610
0,90 90,150 150,210 210,450 450,540
it in the key of

790
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,010
0,570 990,1530 1710,1890 1890,2250 2250,2400
g well the distance for

791
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,140
0,420 420,990 1230,1410 1410,1500 1500,2130
treatment, d and a G.|

792
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,940
0,210 210,300 300,1110
Is a fourth.|

793
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,070
0,720 720,1140 1140,1620 1920,2490 2490,2850
Well, that is five frets

794
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,700
0,360 360,510 510,570 570,1260
worth on a guitar.|

795
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,060
0,330 330,510 510,630 630,810 810,900
So I would have to

796
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,050
0,240 240,420 420,660 660,840 840,990
put it at let's see

797
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,900
0,420 600,1320 1530,2130 2130,2430 2460,2850
what the sixth fret sixth

798
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,210
0,240 240,630 780,1380 1410,1860 1860,2310
fret words sixth frets worth.|

799
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,980
0,360 360,420 420,540 540,660 660,720
Sorry I was right, the

800
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:10,950
0,210 210,390 390,1140 7050,14280 14400,14970
first time fifth zal cables

801
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,900
0,210 210,900 1260,1470 1560,1890 1890,1950
were great, but after I

802
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,100
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,1050 1050,1200
get out too far, it's

803
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,920
0,210 210,270 270,720 720,1200 1350,2820
kind of hard for giselle

804
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,200
0,630 630,1050 1050,1440 1620,2130 2130,2280
hard and too small for

805
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,950
0,300 300,390 390,510 510,600 600,750
fingers to get in there

806
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,630
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,810 870,1680
so they work best down

807
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,770
0,360 360,480 480,570 570,720 720,1140
here now you see the

808
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,940
0,330 330,960 960,1020 1020,1110 1110,1170
mental calculations I had to

809
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,990
0,180 180,540 570,870 870,990 990,1050
go through in order to

810
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,130
0,300 300,390 390,660 660,750 750,1140
find out where to place

811
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,460
0,210
the.|

812
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,450
0,420 420,660 690,1080 1080,1500 1500,1560
Cape oh what's involved is

813
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,410
0,150 150,420 420,540 540,780 780,960
you take the key that

814
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,700
0,210 210,480 480,570 570,960 960,1290
you're doing the chords in

815
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,700
0,420 450,840 840,1200 1200,1800 2310,2580
D G C whatever and

816
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,690
0,60 60,300 300,450 450,600 600,990
the key that you're going

817
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,040
0,360 360,480 480,690 690,1080 1080,1350
to you want to use

818
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,630
0,210 210,600 600,930 1230,1440 1440,1590
those chords in let's say

819
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,260
0,60 60,300 300,360 360,540 540,630
I wanted to use the

820
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,420
0,300 300,870
mini flat.|

821
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,990
0,360 360,480 480,570 570,870 870,960
Okay, and I'm starting on

822
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,960
0,120 120,630
a D.|

823
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,360
0,180 180,450 450,600 600,1170 1170,1260
I count up one the

824
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,680
0,390 390,780 780,1080 1080,1170 1170,1320
distance between d and e

825
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,690
0,300 300,450 450,930 1350,1620 1620,2010
flat is one half step

826
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,830
0,210 210,300 300,570 570,900 900,1140
which is one frets worth

827
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,880
0,90 90,150 150,630 720,990 990,1050
on the guitar, so I

828
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,380
0,240 240,450 840,1020 1020,1140 1140,1500
put it at the first

829
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,060
0,330
fret.|

830
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,070
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,630 630,840
If I were going from

831
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,750
0,480 540,720 720,1200 1470,1590 1590,1680
d to f you have

832
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,370
0,60 60,330 330,570 570,990 1290,1620
to count half steps, D

833
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,440
0,210 210,720
E flat.|

834
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,780
0,240 240,570 600,1140 1530,1770 1770,1890
E flat E E to

835
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,240
0,420 480,750 750,1110 1110,1710 2040,2460
f that's three steps, so

836
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,810
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,480 480,570
I would put it at

837
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,220
0,150 150,540 540,750 750,960 960,1410
the third fret, one two

838
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,900
0,510 1170,6480 6690,7170 7170,7230 7230,7380
three okay thing I wanna

839
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,360
0,180 180,660 690,1050 1050,2010 2160,2460
talk about is harmonics well,

840
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,040
0,180 180,270 270,840 840,1290 1380,1680
what are harmonics well there's

841
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,660
0,60 60,300 300,390 390,810 1290,1620
a couple of things when

842
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,510
0,90 90,330 330,720 720,3990 5460,5850
I play stuff like sorry.|

843
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,700
0,300 300,420 420,510 510,1110
This is a string.|

844
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,490
0,120 120,570 570,1080 1080,1410 1410,1470
The exact midway point of

845
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,200
0,210 210,750 930,1470 1470,1620 1620,1710
that string is at the

846
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,620
0,480 480,870
twelfth fret.|

847
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,070
0,240 240,330 330,600 600,1260 1260,1740
If I just barely touch

848
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,160
0,270 270,690 690,1050 1620,2790 2790,3090
that twelfth fret not fret,

849
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,650
0,270 480,720 720,1020 1020,1410 1710,2490
it just barely touch exactly

850
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,260
0,330 330,450 450,1020 1830,2250 2250,2610
over the fret not behind

851
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,980
0,60 60,300 300,450 450,570 570,720
the threat like we have

852
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,850
0,90 90,270 270,420 420,570 570,870
been doing when we've actually

853
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,200
0,300 300,450 450,630 630,900 1080,1350
figured that if I just

854
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,720
0,360 360,900 1500,1860 1860,1980 1980,2520
barely touched over the fret

855
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,780
0,210 210,330 330,540 540,870 870,1080
can get this bell like

856
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,920
0,330 330,480 480,570 570,720 720,1140
sound, which is the exact

857
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,090
0,330 330,600 600,660 660,750 750,1170
midway point of the string

858
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,920
0,270 270,570 570,990 990,1260 1260,1290
in physical sciences called a

859
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,990
0,660 960,1290 1290,1710 1710,1830 1830,2070
node in music, it's called

860
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,420
0,60 60,720
a harmonic.|

861
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,240
0,150 150,330 330,390 390,480 480,930
There's one at the twelfth

862
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,860
0,360 720,990 990,1080 1080,1350 1350,1620
fret, now it doesn't work,

863
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,640
0,120 120,270 270,330 330,420 420,780
if I'm at the eleventh

864
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,610
0,330 1020,1320 1320,1710 2130,2520 2520,2970
fret doesn't work thirteen threat

865
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,220
0,270 270,630 990,1110 1110,1380 1380,2160
doesn't work it's very precise

866
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,960
0,570 570,1080 1080,1230 1230,1350 1350,1500
twelve threats where you get

867
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,540
0,210
them.|

868
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,240
0,120 120,240 240,480 480,660 660,750
I can also get at

869
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,000
0,60 60,420 420,690 810,2460 2550,2760
the seventh fret I can

870
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,930
0,240 240,420 420,540 540,630 630,930
also get at the fifth

871
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,350
0,270 1800,2100 2100,2460 3000,3240 3240,3420
fret after that it gets

872
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,220
0,180 180,420 420,510 510,690 690,870
pretty hard to get them

873
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,180
0,240 240,330 330,540 540,720 720,810
so the ones that you

874
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,020
0,270 270,390 390,570 570,690 690,840
mainly use this one is

875
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,120
0,90 90,810 810,1920 1920,1980 1980,2100
the {strongest's -} is the

876
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,830
0,240 240,870 1320,1530 1530,1620 1620,1710
next strongest this one is

877
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,320
0,90 90,330 330,870
the next strongest.|

878
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,340
0,330 330,540 540,990 1290,2880 2910,3510
Next week excuse me, sometimes

879
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,360
0,60 60,210 210,720 720,900 900,1020
I can incorporate that into

880
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,470
0,150 150,540 540,690 690,810 810,1110
my playing, if I'm playing

881
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,910
0,180 480,810 810,990 990,1110 1110,1440
a let's see A G

882
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,120
0,510 540,2280 2280,2640 2640,3060 3060,3210
chord zat has opened ii

883
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,490
0,240 240,480 480,750 750,1200 1380,2370
open g open B A

884
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,450
0,150 150,330 330,510 510,750 750,960
I can hit that right

885
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,160
0,420
there.|

886
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,510
0,1110 1110,1350 1350,2040 3060,3300 3300,3390
Zambia d triad would be

887
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,820
0,90 90,330 330,660 780,1740 1740,2310
A G triad zat harmonics

888
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,170
0,150 150,450 570,870 870,1200 1200,1350
and work I also with

889
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:56,920
0,30 30,180 180,300 300,360 360,750
a little bit of effort

890
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,960
0,180 180,570 600,840 840,1110 1110,1920
can do what's called false

891
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,180
0,720 1050,1500 1650,1920 1920,2100 2100,2220
harmonics, OK so let's say

892
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,110
0,60 60,180 180,270 270,570 570,930
I do a barre chord.|

893
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,020
0,540 660,810 810,900 900,1140 1140,1290
Well, if I just play

894
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,310
0,90 90,570 570,840 840,1020 1020,1290
an octave up from each

895
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,690
0,120 120,360 360,960 1080,1290 1290,1380
of these strings I can

896
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,080
0,150 150,450 450,1020
get another harmonic.|

897
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,630
0,180 180,390 390,690 690,810 810,1170
Um with using my first

898
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,400
0,600 870,1020 1020,1200 1200,1590 1590,1770
finger, I'm gonna pluck with

899
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,500
0,150 150,750
my thumb.|

900
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,240
0,270 330,780 780,1050 1050,1170 1170,1500
And barely touch the string

901
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,490
0,120 120,270 270,660 660,1140 1590,2250
with my first finger exactly

902
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,020
0,120 120,630 630,1080 1110,1350 1350,1530
an octave up from where

903
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,070
0,120 120,540 540,720 720,840 840,1050
I'm fingering so if my

904
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,420
0,390 390,510 510,1050
bar is here.|

905
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,120
0,240 240,420 420,990 1260,1410 1410,1530
On this f then I

906
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,110
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,690 690,990
go up to this f

907
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,030
0,540 1020,1350 1350,1590 1590,1740 1740,1920
here barely touch it and

908
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,590
0,270 270,480 510,1260 1260,1410 1410,1560
pluck it and I get

909
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,840
0,90 90,750
the harmonic.|

910
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,740
0,210 210,330 330,330 330,570 570,720
Then, if I just kind

911
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,350
0,150 150,690 690,780 780,1410 1740,2610
of outline the chord c.|

912
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,310
0,600 660,1290 2130,2730 3150,3540 3570,3810
F A C F I

913
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,390
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,420 450,1080
have to kind of outline

914
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,760
0,60 60,720 2880,4980 5010,5220 5220,5370
the chord I can get

915
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,110
0,120 120,420 420,870 870,1200 1230,1350
some false harmonics here I

916
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,820
0,150 150,270 270,750 750,1140 4170,4710
can do melodies with I

917
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:59,640
0,750 750,2670 2730,2910 5310,7230
think if I play.|

918
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,320
0,600 720,990 990,1020 1020,1230 1230,1290
Okay, if I wanted to

919
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,700
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,660 660,1380
do let's say ull scale

920
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:11,220
0,3360 3390,5820 5880,6300 6600,7020 7020,7380
scale, okay, I'm doing this

921
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,680
0,300 300,930 1170,1410 1410,1800 1800,2340
false harmonic I'm pulling off

922
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,100
0,270 270,510 510,720 720,1230
this note right there.|

923
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,790
0,180 180,330 330,690 690,720 720,840
So I'm combining a whole

924
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,300
0,180 180,240 240,510 510,840 2550,3510
bunch of different things you

925
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:32,850
0,2940 7440,8970 11070,11190 11190,11310 11310,11430
sang have you just have

926
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,840
0,60 60,180 180,450 450,810 810,990
to be real accurate where

927
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,610
0,180 180,720 720,840 840,1050 1290,1770
those harmonics are at anyway,

928
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,560
0,270 270,330 330,480 480,900 1110,1890
those are some different techniques

929
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,880
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,810 900,1320
that you can use when

930
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,050
0,480 540,690 690,870 870,1020 1020,1170
playing to throw some little

931
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,120
0,330 330,480 480,570 570,930
spice into your plane.|

932
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,260
0,210 210,360 360,570 570,660 660,1140
Let's talk about our assignment

933
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,690
0,120 120,330 330,750 750,1080 1860,2430
for this this week your

934
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,310

00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,000
0,30 30,180 180,240 240,300 300,690
I want you to practice

936
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,410
0,120 120,510 510,1170 1170,1320 1320,1410
the bending exercises that we

937
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,000
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,720 1020,1590
have in your book practice

938
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,190
0,300 300,1260 1290,1620 1620,1740 1740,2190
bending controlled into a pitch

939
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,810
0,390 390,630 630,1110 1110,1290 1290,1410
memory Larry carlton's thing we

940
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,130
0,150 150,330 330,540 570,930 1200,1320
don't just bend up we

941
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,690
0,360 390,540 540,630 630,1080 1290,1560
bend to a pitch use

942
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,280
0,180 180,480 480,810 810,1500 1500,1590
that major scale exercise to

943
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,330
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,660 660,1050
help you get some strength

944
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:01,960
0,60 60,180 180,420 420,480 480,630
in your hand to do

0,480 750,1110 1110,1230 1230,1320 1320,1470
scale next thing in what

948
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,620
0,120 120,240 240,480 480,600 600,1380
you do is the slide

949
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,360
0,330 330,990 990,1080 1080,1170 1170,1470
riff exercise that we talked

950
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,440
0,300 570,780 780,870 870,1020 1020,1080
about do it on the

951
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,150
0,360 360,840 1290,4380 4410,4650 4650,4710
sixth string OK on the

952
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,600
0,240 240,660 2640,3090 3090,3150 3150,3450
fifth string practicing in different

953
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,710
0,330 330,420 420,660 660,990 990,1110
keys and different places on

954
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,700
0,60 60,300 300,420 420,510 510,990
the next you can incorporate

955
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,290
0,210 210,360 360,570 690,1380 1410,1590
that into your toolkit of

956
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:22,960
0,480
playing.|

957
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,150
0,270 270,510 510,750 750,930 930,1050
Okay whip those out when

0,120 120,270 270,330 330,450 450,510
you need to do a

959
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,500
0,480
solo.|

960
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,890
0,840 840,1320 1500,1680 1680,1890 1890,2160
Practice doing your penta tonic

961
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,270
0,450 450,690 690,780 780,1110 1110,1380
scales using the palm muting

962
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,780
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,660 2880,3510
that we talked about Dr

963
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,310
0,120 120,210 210,450 450,990 990,1530
for a good clear tone

964
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,710
0,450 450,630 630,720 720,900 900,2040
also work on those jazz

965
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:44,180
0,660 690,5040 5070,5490 5520,6360 6360,7260
octaves I pick my thumb

966
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,220
0,480 480,630 630,930 930,4140 4170,4920
back, my third finger slides

967
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,300
0,270 270,420 420,570 570,840 840,1050
all these little things make

968
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,020
0,180 180,570
your plane.|

969
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,070
0,630 630,780 780,1290 1500,1710 1710,1830
Interesting and unique, so we'll

0,330 330,810 810,930 930,1350 1530,1770
proper technique for bends, if

976
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,150
0,0 0,300 300,360 360,630 630,900
I want to bend up

977
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,260
0,210 210,360 360,570 570,750 750,1080
I can use these other

978
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,210
0,630 630,1050 1050,1200 1200,1440 1440,1800
fingers behind this third finger,

979
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,680
0,330 330,720 780,1050 1050,1290 1290,1470
fourth finger to help that

980
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,240
0,390 390,900 1020,1290 1290,1380 1380,1560
string getup okay in order

981
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,590
0,120 120,540 540,690 690,1110 1140,1350
to strengthen that finger we're

982
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,280
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,360 360,690
going to do a simple

983
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,300
0,660 660,720 720,840 840,900 900,1020
exercise, we're going to go

984
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,470
0,150 150,300 300,810 930,1080 1080,1170
from the d to an

985
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,460
0,240 240,330 330,720 720,900 900,990
e ff, bend up to

986
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,270
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,750 750,810
an e flat, just a

987
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,180
0,270 270,660
half step.|

988
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,790
