0,180 180,540 540,630 630,810 810,960
more color in them than

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,260
0,60 60,420 420,690 690,780 780,900

0,300 300,390 390,660 660,870 870,1200
but they still are open

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,550
0,360 360,510 510,840 840,1110 1110,1620
chords that involve open strings.|

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:53,960

0,780 810,1170 1170,1380 1380,1410 1410,1560
ties which gets a little

16
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,940
0,90 90,270 270,960 960,1110 1110,1530
bit more complicated, but sure

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,900
0,420 420,480 480,690 690,720 720,870
makes it sound a little

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,190
0,90 90,210 210,720 720,1140 1140,1290
bit more musically interesting when

19
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,300
0,90 90,270 270,390 780,1050 1050,1110

0,480 510,1080 1080,1590 1770,2100 2100,2370
patterns without music will work

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,960
0,180 180,570 570,990 1080,1350 1350,1380

0,180 180,270 270,540 540,840 840,990
doing it without music because

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,870
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,540 540,1140

a group situation like that.|

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,070

0,750 750,1050 1140,1470 1470,1860 1890,2460
abbreviated a little m seven

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,150
0,210 210,420 420,870 1140,1290 1290,1350
the little m and the

41
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,230
0,510 510,600 600,870 870,960 960,1080

0,60 60,330 330,690 690,960 990,1290
a minor seventh chord, so

43
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,120
0,120 120,240 240,300 300,480 480,600
let's look at that a

44
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,070
0,270 270,600 600,840 840,1350 1560,1950
minor seventh chord first okay

45
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,690
0,450 450,660 660,1050 1080,1500 1500,1590
five stream court everything in

46
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,040

the family.|

47
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,940

00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,140
0,270 270,540 540,960 960,1050 1050,1200
five string court so there's

49
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,310
0,240 240,600 600,720 720,900 900,1170
nothing happening on that six

50
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,020
0,390
string.|

51
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,990
0,180 180,330 330,660 1230,2010 2040,2520
We have open a second

52
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,710

55
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,260
0,240 240,540 780,1380 1380,2700
Just played as a.|

56
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,560
0,120 120,270 270,330 330,480 480,780
It's kind of A C

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,310
0,330 330,420 420,510 510,660 660,750
chord, if you take your

58
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,750
0,240 240,570 570,900 1080,1320 1320,1440
third finger off pretty much

59
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,520
0,60 60,300 300,570 1350,1620 1620,1770
the same thing now let's

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,020
0,150 150,450 450,720 720,1020 1020,1500
talk about d minor seventh,

61
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,860
0,210 210,450 450,600 600,690 690,840
this one is a little

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,120
0,180 180,510 510,660 660,780 780,1260
bit different from the others

63
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,500
0,180 180,240 240,540 540,840 840,1290
it's a four stream cord

64
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,520
0,270 270,360 360,720 720,810 810,990
all the d's are for

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,140
0,300 300,720 960,1230 1230,1380 1380,1620
stream cord, so let's look

66
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,640
0,150 150,510 510,870 1110,1320 1320,1500
what's happening here we've got

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,350
0,300 300,1320 1350,1470 1470,1620 1620,1710
open d I've got my

68
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,850
0,360 360,630 630,750 750,990 990,1500
second finger on this a

69
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,190
0,210 210,930 930,1050 1050,1530 1530,1770
and here's the problem right

70
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,630
0,420 750,900 900,1110 1110,1170 1170,1440
here, I need to put

71
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,190
0,150 150,510 510,1080 1110,1320 1320,1560
my first finger, he needs

72
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,570
0,120 120,450 450,780 780,1260 1260,1380
to cover two strings at

73
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,070
0,570 630,840 840,930 930,1140 1140,1500
once needs to pull double

74
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,580
0,420
duty.|

75
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,920
0,330 330,630 630,780 780,1590 1800,2040
I've got an f and

76
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,180
0,120 120,360 360,480 480,540 540,1260
I've also got A C

77
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,830
0,180 180,210 210,390 390,480 480,1020
that I need to cover

78
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,420
0,180 180,300 300,480 480,540 540,900
now I guess I could

79
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,060
0,180 180,330 330,720 720,2460 2460,2640
really do that zaza right

80
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,350
0,150 150,210 210,390 390,570 1020,1290
way to do it, put

81
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,280
0,90 90,390 390,600 600,720 720,930
your second finger on that

82
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,450
0,420 540,780 780,960 960,1020 1020,1170
a and then I want

83
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,320
0,60 60,120 120,330 330,450 450,870
you to put your first

84
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,520
0,240 240,540 540,810 810,1110 1110,1200
finger down over both of

85
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,700
0,270 270,990
those strings.|

86
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:55,420
0,4980 4980,5130 5520,6000 6000,6270 6270,6450
{Zat's -} this that's the

87
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,500
0,180 180,270 270,330 330,690 690,1050
we're in the baby pool

88
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,390
0,240 420,840 840,1410 1500,1800 1800,1890
of barre chords, this is

89
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,950
0,180 180,720 720,840 840,1170 1170,1560
the introduction to barre chords,

90
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,240
0,330 330,420 420,660 660,930
let me show you.|

91
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,640
0,210 210,540 540,600 600,870 870,1140
So let me talk about

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,360
0,150 150,270 270,510 510,690 690,720
this for saying it's a

93
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,660
0,180 180,330 330,900
pretty big concept.|

94
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,910
0,300 300,390 390,540 540,660 660,720
What you don't want to

95
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,110
0,210 210,420 420,720 720,930 930,1200
do is raise this wrist

96
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,800
0,120 120,300 300,450 450,630 630,690
up because it's hard to

97
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,690 690,1200
push down those two strings

98
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,170
0,270 270,450 450,600 600,870 870,1110
you raise that wrist up,

99
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,610
0,150 150,540 540,750 750,930 930,1260
you crank this up here

100
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,600
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,450 450,630
and you end up doing

101
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,220
0,330 330,570 570,990 1200,1410 1410,1620
something like this, now it

102
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,330
0,210 210,510 510,570 570,810 810,1110
may work a little bit,

103
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,260
0,360 360,600 600,690 690,840 840,930
but when we get to

104
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,490
0,150 150,600 600,810 810,1080 1080,1230
more complex barre chords, you'll

105
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,270
0,180 180,300 300,540 540,630 630,780
see that that is not

106
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,050
0,120 120,180 180,360 360,570 570,780
going to work very very

107
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,670
0,180 180,270 270,570 780,1260 1320,1620
well at all, so here's

108
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,450
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,450 450,780
what you need to do

109
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,100
0,570 570,870 870,1350
lower that risk.|

110
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,840
0,300 300,420 420,1080 1380,1950
Put your finger out.|

111
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,490
0,330 330,930 1440,1590 1590,1770 1770,2340
Your joint will go in.|

112
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,210
0,150 150,210 210,300 300,660 660,870
But it will also go

113
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,190
0,180 180,420 420,720 840,1500 1710,1980
a little bit inverted not

114
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,330
0,210 210,690 780,930 930,1020 1020,1140
very much but I'll go

115
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,770
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,930 1110,1440
a little bit inverted it's

116
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,160
0,180 180,1050
the inverted.|

117
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,900
0,510
AH.|

118
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,220
0,270 270,360 360,690 690,840 840,1080
How the muscles are there

119
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,480
0,180 180,420 420,540 540,870 900,1260
is how you do these

120
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,860
0,300 300,660 660,1020 1020,1200 1200,1380
bar chords, especially these little

121
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,270
0,210 210,420 420,690 990,1320 1320,1410
ones like that, get your

122
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,340
0,420 780,960 960,1080 1080,1860 1860,2070
to get your finger over

123
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,660
0,180 180,360 360,810 840,1260 1260,1320
those two strings kind of

124
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,920
0,570 570,900
invert that.|

125
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,190
0,240 240,330 330,570 570,720 720,810
That's a good way to

126
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,330
0,180 180,240 240,600 600,690 690,1140
get a lot of pressure

127
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,220
0,450 450,570 570,930 930,1380 1650,1890
focused into one spot, if

128
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,820
0,90 90,330 330,420 420,510 510,600
you try and do it

129
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,980
0,120 120,330 330,510 510,750
by just putting your.|

130
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,010
0,630 630,750 750,1110 1110,1200 1200,1650
Raising your wrist and pulling

131
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,120
0,270 270,540 540,720 720,810 810,960
your finger back is not

132
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,860
0,60 60,510 720,1140 1140,1620 1620,1740
a very, um efficient way

133
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,790
0,60 60,210 210,390 540,750 750,930
to do it, put that

134
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,380
0,240 240,750 780,990 990,1260 1260,1590
risk down put that finger

135
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,900
0,150 150,540 630,1260 1260,1770 1860,2520
in front pressing down inverting

136
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,580
0,390
that.|

137
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,650
0,420 420,1200 1230,1650 1650,1920 2010,2280
First finger catching that now

138
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,520
0,240 240,300 300,450 450,720 720,870
trying to add that a

139
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,470
0,270 270,540 1440,1650 1650,1800 1800,1950
to it, so now look

140
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,160
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,600 600,690
what I've got going, I've

141
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,420
0,180 180,690
got one.|

142
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,060
0,360 360,540 540,930 930,1500 1680,1980
Joint that's going normal one

143
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,380
0,210 210,450 450,1020 1020,1140 1140,1320
that's going inverted I'm doing

144
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,000
0,240 240,570 570,1080 1200,1470 1470,1620
two different things with two

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
0,330 330,600 630,1290 1320,1500 1500,1560
different joint joints it's a

146
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,580
0,240 240,450 450,780 780,870 870,1020
little bit tricky to do

147
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,270
0,120 120,600 600,1140 1140,3630 3630,3690
it first, but {zat's -}

148
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,530
0,210 210,510 510,990 990,1170 1170,1260
d minor seventh, once you

149
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,160
0,60 60,150 150,180 180,390 390,630
do it a couple times

150
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,970
0,120 120,480 480,600 600,720 720,810
you'll get you'll get the

151
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,880
0,450 1110,1830
hang of.|

152
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,850
0,660 780,990 990,1290 1290,1560 1560,1710
Okay, the last one is

153
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,140
0,120 180,420 420,840 840,1230 1230,1290
an e minor seventh we're

154
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,910
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,750 1140,1770
going to talk about ease

155
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,370
0,450 450,660 660,1230 1260,1710 1710,2400
family v chords six strings,

156
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,470
0,360 360,510 510,690 690,1140 1170,1740
okay, it's two different fingerings,

157
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,280
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,600 600,810
we can use two different

158
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,810
0,390 390,810 810,930 930,1170 1230,1530
alternate fingerings on this let

159
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,590
0,60 60,270 270,330 330,450 450,780
me teach you the first

160
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,280
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,540 540,690
one is the one I

161
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,570
0,330 420,750 750,1110 1110,1200 1200,1290
like don't necessarily have to

162
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,200
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,510 510,630
do it like I do

163
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,160
0,420 420,660 660,810 810,900 900,960
there's different guys do it

164
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,000
0,240 240,600
different ways.|

165
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,050
0,600 600,1080 1170,1410 1410,1530 1530,1740
Open e now I put

166
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,250
0,120 120,510 510,840 840,960 960,1200
my first finger on this

167
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,100
0,510
b.|

168
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,650
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,570 570,840
Then I have two open

169
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,680
0,600 600,780 780,960 960,1830
strings and d energy.|

170
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,280
0,210 210,330 330,600 600,720 720,1140
Then I have my third

171
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,800
0,660 720,900 900,1050 1050,1710 2250,2520
finger on this heidi, my

172
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
0,600 600,750 750,930 930,1200 1200,1680
pinky on this high g.|

173
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,780
0,210 210,510 510,1170
A minor seventh.|

174
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,650
0,570 600,990 990,1110 1110,1200 1200,1500
Now another way to do

175
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,720
0,540
that.|

176
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,340
0,840
HMM.|

177
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,160
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,540 540,600
Which I think is a

178
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,540
0,150 150,270 270,540 570,1110 1200,1380
little bit more awkward, so

179
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,080
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,390 390,540
it's been a bit more

180
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,770
0,300 300,390 390,540 540,660 660,690
awkward to me, but a

181
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,700
0,180 180,240 240,480 480,720 720,930
lot of guys use it

182
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,800
0,180 180,270 270,630 630,960 990,1500
is an open e second

183
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,670
0,360 360,480 480,600 600,690 690,870
finger up here on this

184
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,480
0,420
b.|

185
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,170
0,480 480,810 810,960 960,1170 1260,1740
Third finger on this e.|

186
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,480
0,930 1410,1830 1830,2190 2190,3900 4320,4440
G pinky covering z the

187
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,530
0,240 240,450 450,750 750,870 870,1050
last string open now you'll

188
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,640
0,270 270,360 360,600 600,690 690,1110
notice the finger is completely

189
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,450
0,300 300,390 390,570 570,660 660,810
different for this one, how

190
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,050
0,90 90,150 150,240 240,330 330,600
can it be the same

191
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,760
0,420 720,990 990,1320 1320,1500 1500,1710
chord well chord is just

192
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,320
0,60 60,660 660,750 750,1260 1410,1560
a combination of tones, no

193
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,820
0,210 210,390 390,810 960,1410 1410,1500
matter how many ways I

194
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,800
0,420 420,690 870,1110 1110,1380 1380,1980
slice them there's still chords.|

195
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,020
0,330 330,510 510,570 570,870 870,1260
There's still the same cord

196
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,950
0,180 180,240 240,450 450,690 690,900
so it doesn't matter really

197
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,910
0,240 240,570 570,720 720,900 900,960
what order I have the

198
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,060
0,300 300,630 1500,1680 1680,2160 2640,3150
notes in so here's version

199
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,040
0,810 1500,3660 3660,4260 4530,4800 4800,4980
one zen to either way

200
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,680
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,900 2100,2640
you can use fun and

201
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
0,390 390,690 690,900 900,1050 1050,1200

Good.|

273
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,940
0,360 420,840 840,930 930,1140 1140,1560
Okay before we talk about

274
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,290
0,600 600,870 870,960 960,1080 1080,1230
suspended chords when you talk

275
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,700
0,210 210,780 780,930 930,1020 1020,1410
about strumming for a second

276
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,040
0,270 270,960 960,1170 1170,1380 1380,2130
because we're getting more complex

277
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,690
0,120 120,270 270,780 930,1320 1320,1650
with our rhythms there strumming

278
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,350
0,60 60,210 210,270 270,390 390,660
is going to have to

279
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,250
0,360 360,450 450,600 600,720 720,840
change a little bit as

280
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,040
0,390 600,930 930,1140 1140,1530
well let's talk about.|

281
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,060
0,300 300,840 840,960 960,1530 1980,2370
Good technique for strumming now

282
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,990
0,150 150,330 330,600 600,750 750,930
at this point we've pretty

283
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,610
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,870 870,1620
much just been going down

284
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,920
0,660 810,1410 1680,1950 1950,2130 2130,2280
down down down we need

285
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,940
0,60 60,210 210,300 300,690 720,1020
to do an up, there'll

286
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,660
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,510 510,720
be a bunch of mina

287
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,830
0,210 210,300 300,420 420,600 600,1170
row and we'll go down

288
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,380
0,450 480,1020 1050,1410 1530,2100 2160,2520
up down up down up

289
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,060
0,480 510,840 930,1290 1290,1440 1440,1560
down up even when you

290
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,980
0,60 60,330 330,720 720,1410 1530,1920
are doing just downs your

291
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,780
0,570
hand.|

292
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,770
0,180 180,450 450,630 630,720 720,1170
Is still doing a silent

293
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,270
0,480 840,960 960,1050 1050,1230 1230,1500
up, if you think about

294
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,800
0,240 540,930 960,1170 1170,1290 1290,1530
it okay so your hand

295
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,120
0,90 90,390 390,600 600,780 780,1320
is always doing this cycle.|

296
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,840
0,690 750,1140 1170,1860 1980,2310 2400,3120
Down up down up down

297
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,220
0,330 510,930 930,1080 1080,1230 1230,1320
up down, it's kind of

298
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,360
0,60 60,480 480,600 600,660 660,1140
a piston in a car,

299
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,300
0,180 180,570 570,960 1200,1800 1830,2430
it's always going down up

300
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,300
0,570 630,1230 1230,1740 1800,2460 2460,3000
down up down up down

301
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,960
0,330
up.|

302
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,390
0,390 420,690 690,870 870,1290 1320,2220
Okay, so when I'm practicing

303
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,250
0,240 240,870 960,1230 1230,1320 1320,1440
this strumming, now we're going

304
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,850
0,60 60,180 180,210 210,390 390,600
to get a little more

305
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,170
0,600 600,750 750,1080 1080,1140 1140,1320
complex, be thinking of that

306
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:02,590
0,90 90,150 150,240 240,360 360,420
so you don't want to

307
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,170
0,90 90,750 1080,1530 1530,1920 1920,2580
go down down down down

308
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,240
0,690 1110,1230 1230,1350 1350,1440 1440,1830
down, that would be wrong

309
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
0,1140 1170,1830 1860,2190 2190,3510 3540,3840
down down up down down,

310
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,220
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,570 570,1020
if you want good smooth

311
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,210
0,720 2580,2850 2850,3000 3000,3900 3930,3990
strumming, see how if I

312
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,290
0,180 180,360 360,1740 3480,3630 3630,4080
do all down it sounds

313
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,550
0,30 30,180 180,330 330,870 1110,1260
a little bit different and

314
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,690
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,660 660,1140
as we get more complex

315
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,530
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,600 600,840
it's going to really start

316
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,580
0,240 240,360 360,600 750,930 930,1050
throwing you off, it's going

317
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,390
0,90 90,210 210,360 360,420 420,810
to make sure you understand

318
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,500
0,120 120,210 210,540 720,900 900,1110
what we're doing, I'm never

319
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,040
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,480 480,540
going to tell you to

320
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,690
0,360 690,1050 1260,1440 1440,1560 1560,1650
be up when you're in

321
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,740
0,60 60,360 360,420 420,570 570,1050
the cycle to be down

322
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,900
0,150 150,300 300,780
or the opposite.|

323
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,890
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,480 480,630
It may be a little

324
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,030
0,450 450,540 540,750 750,930 930,1140
confusing at first but pretty

325
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,930
0,180 180,330 330,630 630,720 720,900
soon you'll realize that that's

326
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,590
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,570 570,660
really the only way you

327
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,430
0,90 90,210 210,390 450,750 750,840
could do it, if you

328
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,470
0,210 210,390 390,720 720,1320 1650,2040
keep that cycle consistent okay,

329
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,360
0,450 450,780 780,1290 1350,1620 1620,1770
that's about strumming, now let's

330
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,000
0,180 180,420 420,720 720,1380
talk about adding ties.|

331
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,470
0,360 360,420 420,870 870,930 930,1230
Into the inside of our

332
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,660
0,510 510,1020 1050,1380 1470,1710 1710,1980
strumming chords okay, so just

333
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,120
0,120 120,210 210,600 600,1110
on A G chord.|

334
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,350
0,360 360,570 570,1140 1140,1350 1350,1860
Let's do exercise number one.|

335
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,420
0,420 990,1140 1140,1440 1440,1650 1650,1710
Okay, the first part of

336
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,920
0,420 420,570 570,870 900,1140 1140,1500
exercise number one is without

337
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,480
0,90 90,570 990,1140 1140,1200 1200,1560
the tie and the second

338
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,350
0,300 330,450 450,690 690,810 810,870
part I through in the

339
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,760
0,480 870,1080 1080,1500 1500,2130
tie, your strumming pattern.|

340
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,070
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,660 660,900
Is going to change just

341
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,300
0,540 570,750 750,840 840,1080 1080,1230
slightly, but the up and

342
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,920
0,420 450,1080 1080,1200 1200,1290 1290,1620
down cycle of your hand

343
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,180
0,210 210,300 300,810 870,1170 1170,1260
is the same whether I'm

344
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,050
0,240 240,300 300,600 600,660 660,870
hitting the strings are not

345
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,140
0,240 240,330 330,810
hitting the strings.|

346
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,620
0,300 300,840 1140,1710
Number one a.|

347
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,170
0,210 210,270 270,480 480,840 870,2040
On A G chord down

348
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,660
0,750 780,1230 1230,2400
down up down.|

349
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,290
0,1050 1170,1290 1290,1380 1380,2160 3240,4200
Okay, one more time down

350
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,570
0,510 510,1290 1290,1440 1440,1740 1740,2250
up down, now even though

351
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,530
0,150 150,330 330,420 420,750 750,930
it's just a half note

352
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,160
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,360 360,630
I want you to keep

353
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,200
0,120 120,570 570,1020 1320,1620 1620,2040
your hand going very important

354
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,420
0,540 630,1110 1110,1290 1290,1740 1740,2220
concept, keep your hand going

355
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,500
0,300 300,390 390,510 510,600 600,990
or you're going to forever

356
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,510
0,270 540,900 900,1320 1320,1530 1530,2010
get turned around on where

357
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,290
0,60 60,210 210,270 270,390 390,780
you need to be playing

358
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,610
0,210 210,690 690,930 930,1020 1020,1080
the secret is let me

359
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,390
0,150 150,210 210,300 300,690 690,780
tell you the secret for

360
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,590
0,390 390,540 540,630 630,750 750,1200
somebody's done it for years.|

361
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,040
0,360 360,510 510,840 840,1320 1410,1950
Keep your hand going okay

362
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,780
0,1350 1380,2100 2100,2580 2580,3600
down down up down.|

363
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,180
0,360 360,360 360,600 600,750 750,1020
Now I know you're saying

364
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,050
0,330 330,480 480,600 600,660 660,870
yourself, why should I keep

365
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,310
0,120 120,360 360,750 780,1050 1050,1260
my hand going on just

366
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,060
0,60 60,360 360,540 540,630 630,750
a half note, I'm going

367
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,810
0,60 60,150 150,450 450,690 690,750
to get worn out, I'm

368
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,580
0,120 120,240 420,990 990,1500 1530,1770
going to die early die

369
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,570
0,270 270,360 360,510 510,780 780,990
young in my life because

370
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,770
0,180 180,600 600,780 780,930 930,1200
I'm wasting all my energy

371
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,300
0,240 240,510 720,1290
doing this, no.|

372
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,550
0,180 180,450 450,510 510,750 750,930
You need to keep that

373
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,330
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,630 630,780
because as we get more

374
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,200
0,90 90,240 240,630 630,750 750,870
and more complex with our

375
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,580
0,570 720,930 930,1080 1080,1200 1200,1380
rhythms, if you don't keep

376
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,720
0,180 180,420 420,840 840,900 900,1140
that hand going to sound

377
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,470
0,390 390,480 480,600 600,660 660,750
shopping, you're going to be

378
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,940
0,120 120,180 180,390 390,600 930,1470
able to keep up okay

379
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,920
0,510 510,960 960,1380 1590,1830 1830,1950
now one b I'm going

380
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,150
0,60 60,240 240,450 450,1020 1050,1230
to throw that tie-in, we

381
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,370
0,180 180,300 300,660 660,1320 1650,2220
had been going down down

382
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
0,360 390,1020 1050,1200 1200,1290 1290,1440
up down, now, I'm just

383
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,590
0,120 120,180 180,390 390,540 540,750
going to take away one

384
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,740
0,60 60,270 270,690
of those downs.|

385
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,750
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,1170 1410,2640
And see what happens down

386
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,280
0,570 600,1260
down up.|

387
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,330
0,1230 1260,1860 1890,2220 2220,2970 3000,3330
Down down up down up

388
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,930
0,840 870,1080 1230,2430 2460,3120 3150,3600
down up down down up

389
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,300
0,660 690,870 900,1680 1710,2160 2160,2370
down up down up you're

390
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,730
0,480 480,780 810,1440 1470,1710 1710,2400
ending your strum on upbeat

391
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,240
0,390 390,570 570,630 630,1080
feels kind of funny.|

392
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,500
0,390 420,540 540,720 720,870 870,960
Okay, let's try one more

393
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,800
0,420 750,1890 1920,2880 2880,2910 2940,3300
time down yeah a little

394
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,690
0,510 510,1410 1470,7440 7440,7590 7590,7890
bit faster Zheng a while

395
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,110
0,60 60,120 120,210 210,360 360,420
for you to kind of

396
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,370
0,180 180,240 240,810 810,900 900,1260
get the concept of this

397
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,370
0,540 540,930 930,1920 1980,2160 2160,2250
down up down, let's do

398
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,180
0,240 240,600
number two.|

399
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,520
0,150 150,390 390,570 570,630 630,810
The first part of it

400
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,420
0,420 450,930 930,1050 1050,1560
a without the tie.|

401
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,810
0,1290 1320,2100 2130,2610 2610,3270 3300,3750
Down down up down up

402
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:59,140
0,720 750,1410 5670,6060 6060,6180 6180,6330
down again when I have

403
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,880
0,90 90,540 540,960 1380,1560 1560,1740
the tie in it then

404
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,170
0,660 690,1890 1920,2550 2580,3420 3750,4290
becomes down down up up

405
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,220
0,990
down.|

406
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,100
0,1470 1500,2160 2190,2730 3270,3840 3840,4680
Down down up up down,

407
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,770
0,810 1110,1650 1680,1890 1890,2040 2040,2640
OK again, don't get confused,

408
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,720
0,270 270,390 390,870 1140,1650 1650,1890
what's the rule, keep your

409
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,340
0,480 480,960 1080,1260 1260,1380 1380,1620

is always going you'll end

411
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,560
0,450 450,660 660,750 750,810 810,1020
up being in the right

412
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,000
0,210 210,270 270,330 330,750 750,1440
part of the cycle to

413
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,140
0,330 330,480 480,570 810,1020 1020,1110
land on it, one more

414
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,580
0,360 360,750 750,1200
time to be.|

415
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,920
0,1440 1470,2310 2340,2850 2910,3600 3630,3960
Down down up down up

416
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,840
0,960 960,1050 1050,1290 1290,1380 1380,1560
down, I'll slow it down

417
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,850
0,150 150,180 180,390 390,780 810,2010
even a little more down.|

418
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,610
0,930 960,1590 1590,1830 1830,1890 1890,2400
Down up, there's a silent

419
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,620
0,420 420,840 930,1710 1710,1830 1830,2010
downs air zen, we come

420
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,390
0,270 270,570 570,1290 1290,1650 1650,1770
back into it, great let's

421
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,430
0,120 120,330 330,780 1560,1950 1950,2040
do number three without the

422
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,460
0,240 240,780
tie first.|

423
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,800
0,690 1020,1590
Ready go.|

424
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,180
0,420 420,660 660,1410 1410,1950 1950,2700
Keep your hand going again.|

425
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,610
0,570 570,1350 1350,1440 1440,1620 1620,2130
Okay, now the b section

426
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,990
0,180 180,300 300,450 450,630 630,1230
I'm gonna throw that tie-in

427
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,680
0,1080 1110,1650 1770,2520 2520,2850 2850,3120
in down up keep your

428
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,490
0,630 630,1560 1800,2580 2610,3180 3180,3810
hand going down up down,

429
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,590
0,570 570,1050 1050,1140 1140,1470 1770,2070
up keep your hands going

430
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,070
0,90 90,240 240,750 750,2820 2970,3480
a bit faster, a little

431
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,270
0,300 450,1020 1020,1470 3390,3750 3750,4200
bit faster, go one more

432
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:25,790
0,7170 7380,8070 8070,8160 8160,8310 8310,8400
zen, now I think we're

433
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,590
0,180 180,330 330,780 780,1170 1380,1800
ready for suspended chords okay

434
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,490
0,300 300,480 480,600 600,660 660,870
we're just going to cover

435
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,210
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,600 600,720
three of them, this will

436
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,710
0,60 60,210 210,990 1110,1350 1350,1500
be the last of our

437
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,510
0,360 360,810 810,1080 1080,1260 1260,1800
basic chords, you have covered

438
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,760
0,390 390,630 630,780 780,1320 1320,1950
probably close to twenty cords

439
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,920
0,270 270,390 390,900
in the last.|

440
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,990
0,300 300,840 900,1140 1140,1470 1470,1860
This session and past sessions

441
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,550
0,270 270,420 420,810 840,1200 1200,1230
so we have crammed a

442
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,480
0,210 210,270 270,600 600,840 840,930
lot of chords into you

443
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,260
0,60 60,120 120,330 330,570 570,780
in a very short amount

444
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,370
0,60 60,480 600,840 840,1050 1050,1110
of time may take a

445
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,200
0,300 300,660 870,1560 1560,1770 1770,1830
while to process all of

446
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,520
0,390 510,750 750,1080 1080,1260 1260,1320
those the last three we're

447
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,900
0,120 120,180 180,540 540,690 690,1380
going to cover are suspended

448
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,840
0,540 720,1830 2040,2550 2550,2730 2730,2940
chords suspended chords is just

449
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,280
0,150 180,480 480,600 600,1170 1230,1440
a way of referring to

450
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,030
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,630 630,750
they're going to take the

451
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,590
0,510 540,840 840,900 900,1020 1020,1560
third note of the scale

452
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,880
0,210 210,660 660,810 810,1050 1050,1140
and suspend it up to

453
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,740
0,120 120,690
the fourth.|

454
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,830
0,210 210,420 420,660 660,810 810,930
We'll learn a little bit

455
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,240
0,180 180,600 750,870 870,1320 1320,1410
more about the mechanics of

456
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,900
0,180 180,210 210,390 390,570 570,660
that a little bit but

457
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,360
0,180 180,660 840,1230 1230,1860 1920,2460
just realize it's related to

458
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,680
0,150 150,480 480,900
the major chord.|

459
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,530
0,540 600,960 960,1350 1350,1890 2040,2250
A our major chord is

460
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,760
0,240 240,450
like this.|

461
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,670
0,480 900,1170 1170,1740 1740,2070 2070,2490
Now for suspended chords suspended

462
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,230
0,240 240,600 600,960 960,1440 1440,1560
chords almost always involve your

463
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,840
0,630 1110,1650 1650,1830 1830,2280 2280,2610
pinky slide that pinky out

464
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,280
0,240 240,570 570,990
just one fret.|

465
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,940
0,1080
MHM.|

466
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,340
0,300 300,450 450,780 780,1560
That's an a suspended.|

467
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,030
0,360 360,510 510,660 660,780 780,990
Now you may be saying

468
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,840
0,390 390,510 510,630 630,750 750,810
yourself well why don't I

469
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,770
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,510 510,930
just play it like this.|

470
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,130
0,810 1080,1380 1380,1440 1440,2430 3660,3930
Well that's a possibility but

471
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,030
0,210 210,390 390,570 570,750 750,900
let's talk about why that's

472
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,980
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,1080 1350,1950
not a good idea suspended

473
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,230
0,360 360,840 840,1320 1320,1740 1890,2250
chords almost always come right

474
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,790
0,360 360,570 570,720 720,1140 1140,1560
next to a major chord,

475
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,480
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,420 420,450
it's kind of like A

476
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,680
0,420 420,510 510,570 570,960 990,1200
Q and a you, you

477
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,060
0,180 180,420 420,900 1050,1290 1290,1380
always seem together like if

478
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,810
0,120 120,390 390,2010 6270,6570 6570,6750
I'm playing A C, I'm

479
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,520
0,300 300,630 630,750 750,1140 1140,1710
just putting my pinky out

480
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,630
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,450 450,540
if I did it, the

481
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,770
0,210 210,420 420,510 510,720 720,1140
other way, it wouldn't work

482
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,920
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,660 660,960
I have to really whack

483
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,690
0,180 180,300 300,930 1530,1650 1650,1770
out my hand in order

484
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,890
0,90 90,270 270,360 360,690 1050,1200
to get to work so

485
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,550
0,90 90,300 300,510 510,570 570,660
it's much easier to do

486
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,870
0,120 120,240 240,750 1050,1230 1230,1320
with your painting, that's why

487
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,530
0,30 30,300 300,360 360,420 420,660
I encourage you to learn

488
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,320
0,150 150,360
that way.|

489
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,060
0,690 720,930 930,1380 1380,1470 1470,1560
Okay d suspended as the

490
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,940
0,270 270,510
next one.|

491
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,590
0,330 360,540 540,750 750,1200 1200,1350
Okay, now look carefully at

492
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,330
0,90 90,840 870,1170 1170,1380 1380,1740
the numbers on that chord

493
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,670
0,420 450,780 780,930 930,1530 1740,2340
block tells you where those

494
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,140
0,240 240,300 300,510 510,600 600,1230
where to put your fingers

495
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,370
0,180 180,330 330,660 660,960 960,1050
it may seem odd at

496
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,110
0,330 330,480 480,1080 1110,1320 1320,1740
first but remember we're relating

497
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,280
0,150 150,210 210,300 300,660 660,1170
it to the major chord,

498
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,350
0,360 360,480 480,1020 1440,1560 1560,1740
here's A D I just

499
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,240
0,150 150,240 240,600 600,1110 1620,1890
put my pinky down that's

500
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,040
0,60 60,300 300,1410 1410,1650 1650,1800
A D suspended don't play

501
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,200
0,240 240,1890 1890,1950 1950,2100 2100,2160
like {zat's -} not a

502
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,980
0,150 150,270 270,330 330,600 600,780
good way to play it

503
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,630
0,210 210,300 300,390 390,510 510,1080
play it with a D.|

practice on your own to

949
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,580
0,300 300,390 390,570 570,600 600,780
speed it up a little

950
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,420
0,240 330,450 450,630 630,660 660,840
bit and make a little

951
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,590
0,210 210,420 420,570 780,1020 1020,1170
more to it, now there's

952
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,670

your in your resources that

954
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,440
0,120 120,270 270,750
you have available.|

955
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,330
0,180 180,330 330,420 420,570 570,720
Go ahead and go through

956
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,380
0,150 150,390 390,510 510,630 630,1050
as many as you can.|

957
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,510
0,540 720,1050 1050,1170 1170,1380 1380,1560
Now, before we go in

958
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,950
0,150 150,600 600,1020 1020,1140 1140,1440
our last minute I want

959
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,360
0,270 270,780 780,900 900,960 960,1110
to explain to you you've

960
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,040
0,270 270,750 750,870 870,1260 1380,1680
probably realized by now that

961
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,090
0,330 330,600 600,840 840,900 900,1050
guitar playing takes a little

962
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:43,980
0,120 120,180 180,600
bit of effort.|

963
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,200
0,330 330,540 540,660 660,870 870,960
I'm sure you thought that

964
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,250
0,120 120,210 210,510 540,990 990,1050
you could just watch a

965
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,260
0,150 150,510 510,660 660,1020 1380,2010
little something and you'd be

966
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,610
0,180 180,240 240,420 420,900 1080,1350
able to play guitar, but

967
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,450
0,60 60,240 240,420 420,480 480,840
it does take an awful

968
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,200
0,150 150,210 210,540 540,630 630,750
lot of effort but it's

969
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,400
0,360 360,660 660,750 750,1080 1080,1200
well worth the time and

970
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,540
0,330 330,480 480,600 600,900 900,1140
effort that you're putting in

971
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,940
0,240 240,450 450,1260 1260,1500 1500,1920
into your musicianship into you're

972
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,580
0,570 570,1140 1170,1290 1290,1560 1560,2160
making yourself a better person

973
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,810
0,330 330,600 600,720 720,810 810,1050
by learning how to play

974
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,550
0,420 420,750 750,900 900,1350 1470,1740
guitar yes it's tough and

975
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,450
0,30 30,180 180,240 240,510 510,900
a lot of people quit.|

976
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,630
0,540 570,780 780,960 960,1200 1200,1650
Um, but you've stuck around

977
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,130
0,270 270,600 780,1260 1260,1320 1320,1500
and you're continuing to do

978
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,390
0,300 300,420 420,510 510,810 900,1260
it and I think you're

979
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,020
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,390 390,630
going to be the one

980
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,280
0,180 180,480 480,570 570,1080 1080,1260
that reaches the rewards out

981
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,570
0,60 60,390 480,720 720,1050 1050,1290
of this, if guitar playing

982
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,220
0,180 180,600 870,1080 1080,1500 1500,1650
was easy, then everybody would

983
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:12,840
0,120 120,300
do it.|

984
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,260
0,270 270,570 570,840 840,960 960,1140
A usually everybody can kind

985
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,160
0,60 60,270 270,480 480,540 540,900
of thumb around a few

986
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,810
0,660 720,990 990,1110 1110,1350 1350,1470
chords, but for folks to

987
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,950
0,300 300,480 480,630 630,780 780,1140
actually know what they're doing

988
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,730
0,150 150,300 300,330 330,540 540,780
and get a few more

989
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,870
0,360 360,480 480,660 660,870 870,1140
chords and go just beyond

990
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,460
0,450 510,780 780,990 990,1140 1140,1590
average it takes some effort

991
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,510
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,690 690,810
and that's what this is

992
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,680
0,510 630,780 780,990 990,1110 1110,1170
about in life, there are

993
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,670
0,180 180,420 420,480 480,780 780,990
three kinds of people there's

994
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,060
0,600 750,1650 2040,2220 2220,2760 2760,3390
quitters campers and climbers quitters,

995
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,380
0,420 420,510 510,600 600,960 960,1110
look at the task ahead

996
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,280
0,60 60,180 180,300 300,540 540,900
of them, they say nah

997
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,880
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,480 480,600
there's no way I could

998
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,660
0,150 150,300 300,570
ever do that.|

999
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,850
0,300 300,780 780,990 990,1440 1440,1650
And campers get halfway up

1000
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,690
0,90 90,210 210,480 480,720 720,840
and they think man, this

1001
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:35,650
0,150 150,270 270,570 570,690 690,960
is as far as I

1002
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,670
0,240 240,300 300,510 510,660 660,990
care to go, it's just

1003
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,200
0,210 210,630 630,720 720,930 930,1410
the cost is too much,

1004
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,490
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,780 780,1200
it takes too much effort,

1005
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:40,450
0,210 210,330 330,390 390,630 630,720
but there are those of

1006
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,890
0,120 120,360 360,960 1110,1380 1380,1440
you that climb and I

1007
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:42,760
0,210 210,270 270,480 480,780 780,870
want to keep going to

1008
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,560
0,270 270,390 390,840 1170,1500 1500,1800
try and climb and to

1009
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,790
0,150 150,420 420,510 510,720 750,1230
um get to the musical
