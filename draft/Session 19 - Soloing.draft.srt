00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,995
0,60 60,180 180,405 405,1050 1050,1365
to talk about soloing many

4
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:45,210
0,270 270,480 480,735 735,1020 1020,1215
different kinds of aspects of

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,000
0,530
soing.|

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,795
0,105 105,240 240,420 420,600 600,795
We talk about what makes

7
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:48,870
0,195 195,345 345,510 510,1025 1315,2075
up a good solo melody

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,115
0,610 780,1055 1055,1580 1580,1865 1865,2105
rhythm. {The,harmonic -} structure of

9
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:52,260
0,275 295,585 585,705 705,840 840,1145
it needs to have balance,

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,155
0,290 290,485 485,635 635,755 755,875
and most of all, you

11
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:54,250
0,105 105,270 270,510 510,795 795,1095
need to say something that's

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,360
0,260
meaningful.|

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,485
0,270 270,660 660,810 810,960 960,1125
What doesn't make a good

14
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:57,280
0,330 330,435 435,540 540,645 645,795
solo and a lot of

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,450
0,240 240,405 405,630 630,945 945,1170
traps? The guitar players fall

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,920
0,290 670,960 960,1110 1110,1275 1275,1470
into how to build up

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,195
0,150 150,360 360,960 960,1155 1155,1275
your own creativity, how to

18
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,235
0,210 210,545 715,1095 1095,1475 1765,2040
start hearing guitar parts and

19
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:03,955
0,150 150,315 315,480 480,615 615,720
being able to put them

20
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:05,275
0,165 165,345 345,495 495,785 1045,1320
out through your fingers. We're

21
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:06,355
0,165 165,405 405,600 600,960 960,1080
gonna talk about soloing in

22
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:07,705
0,225 225,540 540,870 870,1185 1185,1350
various different playing styles and

23
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:08,185
0,105 105,195 195,270 270,375 375,480
get you a lot of

24
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,810
0,150 150,455 805,1095 1095,1305 1305,1625
good practice in doing those.|

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,180
0,90 90,195 195,315 315,525 525,780
In the how music works

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,960
0,255 255,465 465,525 525,615 615,780
section, we're going to learn

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,145
0,240 240,465 465,660 660,930 930,1185
about getting our fingers to

28
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:14,525
0,150 150,285 285,875 1015,1275 1275,1380
play the melodies that we

29
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:15,430
0,120 120,315 315,480 480,615 615,905
are hearing in our head

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,380
0,320 320,620 620,890 890,1180 1260,1660
and choosing the right ideas,

31
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,565
0,365 365,635 635,1210 1230,1520 1520,1715
taking good melodies and putting

32
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:20,890
0,150 150,270 270,545 655,990 990,1325
them in different playing situations

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,160
0,245 245,350 350,485 485,740 740,1010
so that we can make

34
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,030
0,135 135,300 300,480 480,675 675,870
the most out of the

35
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,260
0,150 150,300 300,435 435,710
little that we learn.|

36
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,085
0,300 300,510 510,675 675,750 750,825
Okay, so let's go ahead

37
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,315
0,90 90,225 225,515 835,1080 1080,1230
and get started. {Okay,,let's -}

38
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,090
0,135 135,345 345,900 900,1205 1225,1775
talk about soloing or {improvising.,What

39
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,945
0,260 260,485 485,965 965,1360 1440,1715
-} does improvising mean? That

40
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:31,955
0,210 210,545 715,1095 1095,1475 1705,2010
means just making up off

41
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:32,770
0,165 165,300 300,405 405,525 525,815
the top of your head

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,880
0,305 305,970 1050,1325 1325,1460 1460,1640
a melody that you can

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,020
0,240 240,555 555,810 810,945 945,1140
play along with the songs

44
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,475
0,180 180,360 360,555 555,920 1120,1455
that you're {going,for.,Okay? - -}

45
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:38,315
0,180 180,270 270,405 405,645 645,840
So you are making it

46
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,325
0,245 325,645 645,870 870,1175 1615,2010
up {on,the -} spot. Sometimes

47
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:41,030
0,240 240,345 345,465 465,570 570,705
you can kind of have

48
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,050
0,255 255,540 540,720 720,870 870,1020
something pre made up, but

49
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,030
0,180 180,390 390,525 525,675 675,980
most all of this is

50
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,155
0,550 1080,1445 1445,1670 1670,1850 1850,2105
improvising, choosing the {right,notes -}

51
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:46,160
0,225 225,515 565,795 795,870 870,1005
to play. There are many

52
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,030
0,210 210,435 435,600 600,705 705,870
different ways that you can

53
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,300
0,300 300,950
approach soloing.|

54
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,830
0,320 790,1080 1080,1215 1215,1365 1365,1530
Okay, first of all, you

55
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,640
0,120 120,255 255,435 435,630 630,810
can get some key bits

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
0,270 270,645 645,915 915,1095 1095,1400
of information from the key.

57
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,700
0,350 350,635 635,755 755,935 935,1400
{What?,What's -} the key signature

58
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,975
0,225 225,560 640,960 960,1140 1140,1275
telling you? What key are

59
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:55,860
0,135 135,395
we in?|

60
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,745
0,225 225,390 390,585 585,720 720,885
Doesn't matter what the first

61
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:57,630
0,210 210,315 315,420 420,615 615,885
chord of the song is,

62
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,315
0,345 345,555 555,920 1000,1400 2260,2685
what's that key information? That's

63
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:01,155
0,195 195,435 435,585 585,705 705,840
what it may or may

64
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,160
0,275 325,600 600,720 720,840 840,1005
not go with the first

65
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,075
0,210 210,315 315,435 435,690 690,915
chord of the song, but

66
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:04,290
0,165 165,465 465,780 780,1005 1005,1215
that key information is telling

67
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,180
0,320 700,1020 1020,1340 1390,1695 1695,1890
you what major scale that

68
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,395
0,240 240,420 420,660 660,1005 1005,1215
you're able to solo around

69
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,505
0,335 355,630 630,780 780,930 930,1110
in and get the sounds

70
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:09,840
0,180 180,345 345,540 540,905
that you're going for.|

71
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,785
0,305 305,470 470,590 590,725 725,905
Another way to look at

72
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:11,985
0,210 210,375 375,555 555,875 925,1200
is to use patterns like

73
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:13,395
0,150 150,720 720,945 945,1215 1215,1410
our pentatonic scale patterns that

74
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,000
0,120 120,285 285,575 1105,1425 1425,1605
we learned earlier. {Okay,,we -}

75
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,320
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,800 1000,1320
can use those somewhat. It's

76
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,055
0,90 90,255 255,435 435,570 570,735
a good thing to whip

77
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:17,655
0,165 165,300 300,390 390,525 525,600
out, but we don't want

78
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:18,690
0,105 105,255 255,540 540,840 840,1035
to just go straight down

79
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,875
0,195 195,500 550,825 825,1050 1050,1185
those {patterns.,That -} doesn't make

80
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,520
0,120 120,365 415,720 720,1205
a very interesting solo.|

81
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,145
0,275 275,500 500,710 710,845 845,1235
We can also be guided

82
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:24,740
0,165 165,330 330,615 615,1025 1195,1595
by the chord tones used

83
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,295
0,275 275,500 500,1055 1055,1175 1175,1385
in the progression that you're

84
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,270
0,195 195,420 420,645 645,780 780,975
working on. That's probably the

85
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,995
0,255 255,590 880,1155 1155,1395 1395,1725
key way. {The,chord -} tones

86
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:30,680
0,345 345,725 745,1035 1035,1305 1305,1685
are vital to telling you

87
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,250
0,335 335,620 620,935 935,1235 1235,1430
what notes are safe at

88
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,060
0,180 180,375 375,510 510,660 660,810
any point in time as

89
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,190
0,165 165,315 315,480 480,645 645,1130
you're going through these solo.|

90
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,940
0,400
Ideas.|

91
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,225
0,290 290,440 440,620 620,860 860,1085
Or you can use all

92
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,220
0,150 150,300 300,605 685,1770 1770,1995
of these techniques simultaneously. {Well,,let's

93
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,330
0,210 210,390 390,615 615,855 855,1110
-} first talk about what

94
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,425
0,240 240,510 510,750 750,900 900,1095
is making up a good

95
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:42,925
0,375 375,525 525,750 750,1065 1065,1500
{solo.,How -} come so solos

96
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,020
0,165 165,455 595,855 855,960 960,1095
are good? How come other

97
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,935
0,180 180,360 360,630 630,765 765,915
ones just don't sound like

98
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:46,000
0,150 150,330 330,635 655,975 975,1065
they fit right? There's a

99
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,110
0,150 150,330 330,620 640,960 960,1110
couple of key aspects {to,it.

100
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,435
0,230 460,780 780,1020 1020,1700 2050,2325
-} {First,is -} melody. You

101
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,800
0,255 255,875
want catchy?|

102
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,980
0,260
Um.|

103
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,120
0,755 755,1250 1250,1445 1445,1730 1730,1910
Noteworthy melody, as you're as

104
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,005
0,240 240,435 435,645 645,780 780,885
you're playing it, you want

105
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,570
0,120 120,330 330,585 585,885 885,1565
to create something that's memorable.|

106
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,470
0,290 290,580 1260,1550 1550,1730 1730,1970
You want everything to fit

107
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,045
0,350 730,1020 1020,1200 1200,1350 1350,1575
together. {So,first -} thing is

108
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:02,730
0,660 660,975 975,1170 1170,1365 1365,1685
{melody.,Second -} thing is balance.|

109
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,025
0,165 165,330 330,560 820,1065 1065,1185
You don't want to be

110
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,840
0,210 210,720 720,915 915,1205 1285,1815
playing something up high. Something's

111
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,690
0,120 120,410 760,1290 1290,1500 1500,1850
up low, something's fast, something

112
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,290
0,400 630,890 890,1040 1040,1220 1220,1580
slow and just be jerking

113
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,750
0,180 180,435 435,675 675,1095 1095,1460
all around. {That,greets, -} creates

114
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,455
0,365 365,590 590,695 695,980 980,1055
confusion in the listener and

115
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:14,205
0,225 225,360 360,495 495,630 630,750
doesn't end up being a

116
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:15,820
0,150 150,585 585,1085
very melonic solo.|

117
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,320
0,305 305,470 470,605 605,740 740,890
Third thing is you need

118
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,895
0,225 225,525 525,890 1240,1485 1485,1575
to say something. {One,of -}

119
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:19,705
0,120 120,315 315,555 555,720 720,810
my good friends is a

120
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:20,545
0,375 375,495 495,585 585,690 690,840
guitarist by the name of

121
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:21,655
0,270 270,735 735,870 870,990 990,1110
David moy, who used to

122
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:22,750
0,195 195,480 480,915 915,1020 1020,1095
be a guitarist for the

123
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,320
0,195 195,560 580,980
group air supply.|

124
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,120
0,275 275,380 380,455 455,910
Back in the eighties.|

125
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,365
0,320 460,780 780,960 960,1125 1125,1245
And David was telling me

126
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:28,250
0,90 90,285 285,495 495,690 690,885
a story one time about

127
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,795
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,860 1270,1545
he's up on stage down

128
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:30,875
0,225 225,510 510,735 735,900 900,1080
in Australia, I believe, in

129
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,090
0,255 255,570 570,870 870,1065 1065,1215
Sydney, where air supply is

130
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,000
0,290
from.|

131
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,740
0,260 260,515 515,790 930,1330 1350,1700
And they're playing and I

132
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,355
0,210 210,345 345,435 435,510 510,615
forget whether it was the

133
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:36,765
0,240 240,480 480,585 585,845 1015,1410
manager of the band or

134
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:37,515
0,240 240,375 375,495 495,600 600,750
the owner of the club

135
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:38,565
0,150 150,375 375,690 690,840 840,1050
or something. He's back there

136
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:39,420
0,195 195,360 360,615 615,750 750,855
playing a solo. He's got

137
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,960
0,105 105,350 370,770
his eyes closed.|

138
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,250
0,290 290,580 690,965 965,1100 1100,1250
And he opens his eyes

139
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,135
0,105 105,240 240,375 375,615 615,885
and there's this guy standing

140
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:43,915
0,240 240,420 420,555 555,645 645,780
right in front of him

141
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:46,340
0,305 775,1140 1140,1380 1380,1655
saying, speak to me.|

142
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,460
0,350 350,590 590,935 935,1250 1250,1630
And he relates that story

143
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,760
0,400 750,1100 1100,1450 1470,2225 2225,2860
about not just musically mumbling,

144
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,750
0,290 290,500 500,785 785,1150 1320,1730
not just playing whatever pops

145
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,400
0,180 180,390 390,680 1090,1380 1380,1650
into your head. {But,by -}

146
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,795
0,380 430,795 795,1020 1020,1185 1185,1395
saying something when you play

147
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:57,440
0,165 165,285 285,420 420,540 540,645
and when you try and

148
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,610
0,105 105,240 240,710 820,1125 1125,1170
do a solo, it's a

149
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,005
0,75 75,180 180,440 760,1080 1080,1395
little bit like a chef

150
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:00,940
0,225 225,360 360,480 480,645 645,935
trying to make a good,

151
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,135
0,275 275,485 485,740 740,920 920,1055
a good {meal.,You -} have

152
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,650
0,120 120,225 225,390 390,695 1165,1515
to get all {these,aspects. -}

153
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,150
0,285 285,620 850,1110 1110,1305 1305,1500
Just right now, we've talked

154
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,350
0,240 240,435 435,705 705,990 990,1200
about many different things we've

155
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,200
0,150 150,470
talked about.|

156
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,985
0,635 635,910 1020,1310 1310,1490 1490,1775
Pentatonic patterns talked about major

157
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:11,070
0,425 835,1185 1185,1535 1735,1995 1995,2085
scales and keys, but now

158
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,000
0,135 135,225 225,435 435,690 690,930
we're gonna use all those

159
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,930
0,240 240,450 450,615 615,780 780,930
tools to try and see

160
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,090
0,210 210,480 480,690 690,870 870,1160
what makes up a good

161
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,130
0,620 620,845 845,950 950,1115 1115,1720
solo and a good melody.|

162
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,920
0,275 275,470 470,725 725,1010 1010,1310
Some things that guitar players

163
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
0,255 255,495 495,780 780,1125 1125,1440
fall into these traps all

164
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,455
0,240 240,530 550,840 840,990 990,1095
the time when trying to

165
00:04:20,455 --> 00:04:21,520
0,120 120,270 270,720 720,930 930,1065
make a solo, and they

166
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,375
0,255 255,525 525,630 630,720 720,855

0,150 150,405 405,555 555,705 705,870
that don't make a good

168
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:25,110
0,515 775,1050 1050,1230 1230,1500 1500,1865
{solo.,One -} is finger patterns.|

169
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,550
0,330 330,645 645,915 915,1080 1080,1590
It's great. {All,these -} pentatonic

170

0,210 210,420 420,660 660,855 855,1050
patterns that we've learned and

to actually play a solo,

0,275 275,470 470,545 545,620 620,755
you don't want to be

0,255 255,570 570,900 900,1125 1125,1260
playing {finger,patterns. -} It just

0,240 240,495 495,840 840,1170 1170,1520
thing that guitar players think

0,290 290,440 440,590 590,890 890,1130

0,150 150,375 375,570 570,720 720,855
of thinking it has to

0,210 210,420 420,660 660,1040 1180,1440
all these color tones and

206
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,890
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,540 540,690

0,165 165,650 850,1230 1230,1610 1960,2235
{good,solo. {-},Not -} necessarily. Quite

0,225 225,465 465,615 615,750 750,915
often times it just ends

209
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,470
0,150 150,405 405,675 675,1080 1080,1430
up being a confusing mess

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,800
0,260 260,380 380,560 560,740 740,860
because your note have the

here's where the tool bag

0,560 560,755 755,980 980,1235 1235,1415
Creativity is taking all the

0,180 180,330 330,510 510,690 690,915
tools that we've learned so

227
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,585
0,290 370,660 660,930 930,1215 1215,1365
far and using them to

228
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:47,740
0,120 120,300 300,690 690,915 915,1155

0,305 305,515 515,1025 1025,1300 1350,1670
Putting these pentatonic patterns out

0,270 270,570 570,855 855,1110 1110,1305

0,90 90,210 210,360 360,615 615,915
we have to. We use

00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,940
0,380 520,870 870,1110 1110,1365 1365,1650
them to actually create something

235
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,265
0,315 315,540 540,1100 1300,1700 2050,2325
that's that's memorable. {Okay?,Just,like -

236
00:05:58,265 --> 00:05:59,075

0,135 135,270 270,435 435,675 675,990
up by just choosing random

238
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:01,430
0,300 300,480 480,570 570,1110 1110,1365
words from the dictionary, so

239
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,510
0,120 120,285 285,630 630,915 915,1080

0,345 345,600 600,765 765,960 960,1265
patterns and putting them together.|

0,275 275,440 440,680 680,905 905,1025
I heard someone say, and

243
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:09,025
0,285 285,495 495,690 690,900 900,1170
I've always thought this in

244
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,410
0,695 1165,1500 1500,1770 1770,2055 2055,2385

0,245 245,365 365,515 515,665 665,830
And I think that is

247
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,160
0,240 240,590 670,930 930,1050 1050,1230

249
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,575
0,275 275,500 500,620 620,740 740,875

00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,740
0,180 180,375 375,1085 1405,1785 1785,2165
of key concepts to choosing

251
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,510
0,365 365,695 695,950 950,1130 1130,1600

0,400 570,845 845,1055 1055,1390 1710,1970
Okay, the first is look

253
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,105

0,150 150,315 315,525 525,845
is this song in?|

255
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,730
0,290 290,530 530,725 725,845 845,980
Now, sometimes it can be

256
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,800
0,360 360,660 660,1280
deceiving a cord.|

257
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,415
0,165 165,285 285,375 375,480 480,615
Can be in the key

258
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:32,510
0,180 180,485 535,825 825,975 975,1095
of c, as well as

00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,190
0,105 105,210 210,315 315,420 420,680
in the key of f,

0,365 365,575 575,650 650,755 755,875
and also in the key

0,230 230,305 305,530 530,725 725,875
So you can't necessarily look

263
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:37,135
0,90 90,180 180,480 480,600 600,720
at the chords all the

0,380 380,725 725,935 935,1055 1055,1205
some information from all these

0,210 210,545 745,990 990,1095 1095,1245
different parts, and a big

267

0,320 490,780 780,960 960,1185 1185,1425
Okay, if the song has

270
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,480
0,255 255,510 510,690 690,965 1075,1455
one flat in it, chances

271
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,365
0,270 270,420 420,555 555,705 705,885
are you could pretty much

0,275 275,485 485,560 560,635 635,725
and you'd be in the

274
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:51,595
0,180 180,510 510,765 765,885 885,990

the key gives us a

276
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:53,845
0,305 325,725 805,1065 1065,1185 1185,1320
good framework that we can

0,290 290,425 425,515 515,590 590,665
Next, we want to look

282
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,070
0,90 90,180 180,725 1015,1365 1365,1695

0,105 105,345 345,645 645,960 960,1275
a very big key of

0,335 355,660 660,870 870,1035 1035,1185
what to play when you're

for two bars and g

395

0,105 105,255 255,330 330,420 420,570
so let's hear how that

397
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,480
0,290
sounds.|

398
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,385
0,400 540,920 920,995 995,1240 1260,1595
Now wasn't the most exciting

399
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,150
0,315 315,390 390,480 480,630 630,765
melody in the world, but

400
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,305
0,150 150,390 390,675 675,945 945,1155
I stayed real safe. {I,played

401
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,670
0,180 180,375 375,600 600,935 1105,1365
-} those court tones and

402

0,135 135,255 255,420 420,585 585,765
don't just wake up one

404
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
0,150 150,300 300,630 630,1050 1050,1200
day and suddenly magically able

0,180 180,345 345,620
to play a.|

406

0,365 365,785 785,980 980,1250 1250,1505
Great solo. {It,starts -} by

407
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:36,510
0,255 255,525 525,795 795,1145 1555,1955
learning those chord {tones.,Okay, -}

408
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,750
0,320 320,530 530,665 665,875 875,950
now we're gonna let's do

409
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,640
0,75 75,165 165,255 255,495 495,890
it in a {different,style.,So -

410
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,415
0,230 230,305 305,395 395,500 500,665
-} I need to think

411
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:41,340
0,195 195,330 330,465 465,755 1525,1925
what can I do differently

412
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,400
0,305 305,425 425,620 620,875 875,1040
that be more appropriate than

413
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,585
0,195 195,560 730,975 975,1050 1050,1185
that style? Now the next

414
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:44,440
0,180 180,330 330,435 435,645 645,855
style we're gonna cover is

415
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,295
0,120 120,180 180,285 285,525 525,855
kind of {a,rock -} thing.

416
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:46,015
0,195 195,315 315,435 435,585 585,720
So I'm gonna kick on

417
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:47,845
0,135 135,570 570,965 1375,1680 1680,1830
my distortion here, maybe a

418
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,375
0,120 120,255 255,435 435,755 1165,1530
little bit of delay, maybe

419
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,410
0,300 300,465 465,675 675,915 915,1035
crank it down here a

420
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,325
0,135 135,420 420,675 675,810 810,915
little bit, get more of

421
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,095
0,90 90,480 480,845 1195,1590 1590,1770
a distorted sound. Let's try

422
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:54,565
0,285 285,570 570,1110 1110,1350 1350,1470
that same chords. I'm just

423
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:55,645
0,240 240,510 510,720 720,900 900,1080
gonna change up the feel

424
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:56,370
0,165 165,270 270,345 345,450 450,725
of it a little bit.|

425
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,960
0,260
Okay.|

426
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,705
0,400 990,1325 1325,1595 1595,1730 1730,1985
Now, granted, that's not the,

the, the.|

0,320 320,740 740,1040 1040,1295 1295,1385
Most hippest example you'll hear

429
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:40,920
0,105 105,210 210,435 435,675 675,915
on the radio, but that's

430
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,345
0,240 240,480 480,740 910,1215 1215,1425
basically the concept I changed

431
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:43,065
0,135 135,225 225,375 375,525 525,720
to a rock and roll

432
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:43,815

0,120 120,225 225,330 330,465 465,740
I wanted it to {sound.,I

435
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,830
0,275 275,425 425,605 605,755 755,860
-} started using a lot

436
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,910
0,150 150,585 585,735 735,915 915,1080
of bends and things which

437
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,460
0,120 120,300 300,1020 1020,1215 1215,1550
are very characteristic in in

438
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,255
0,365 365,730 870,1130 1130,1280 1280,1385
{rock,playing. -} Okay, let's {do,one

439
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:52,335
0,165 165,455 685,930 930,1005 1005,1080
-} more. You want to

440

0,180 180,510 510,750 750,915 915,1200
be appropriate to the style

441
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:54,765
0,255 255,480 480,725 805,1080 1080,1230
that you're in and not

442
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:55,575
0,165 165,315 315,435 435,615 615,810
just play the same thing

443
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:56,800
0,165 165,285 285,465 465,815
over and over again.|

444
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,195
0,255 255,360 360,540 540,860 1120,1395
Let's do one more. {This,one

446
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,280
0,165 165,420 420,705 705,1040 1210,1500
a soft rock thing, so

447
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,400
0,290
I.|

448
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,405
0,290 290,485 485,605 605,740 740,905
Maybe I'll warm up my

449
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:03,185
0,195 195,315 315,450 450,645 645,780
sound a little bit, put

450
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:04,325
0,75 75,210 210,515 715,990 990,1140
it on upper, pick up

451
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,950
0,275 535,825 825,945 945,1080 1080,1625
here, throw a little chorus,

452
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,070
0,365 365,455 455,545 545,695 695,950
let's see what that sounds

453
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,200
0,350
like.|

454
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,635
0,320 320,620 620,860 860,1040 1040,1265
Now there I was pretty

455
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,330
0,210 210,630 630,990 990,1385 1435,1695
much sticking right close to

456
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,320
0,165 165,435 435,705 705,900 900,990
those chord tones, trying to

457
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,570
0,120 120,300 300,705 705,930 930,1250

0,245 245,320 320,425 425,850 960,1250
but I was sticking pretty

459

0,350 520,920 1330,1665 1665,1950 1950,2300
Okay, remember to say something,

461
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,670
0,395 395,695 695,905 905,1325 1325,1630
not just to noodle around

462
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,315
0,245 245,395 395,680 680,1060 1350,1625

0,165 165,390 390,660 660,960 960,1275
how music works section about

0,290 290,425 425,650 650,890 890,1025
Remember the items that we

470
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:14,375
0,135 135,255 255,420 420,630 630,810

00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,680
0,135 135,315 315,575
when we so.|

472
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,490
0,105 105,225 225,435 435,645 645,810
Are we creating a good

473
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,020
0,570 570,810 810,990 990,1230 1230,1530

0,380 760,1020 1020,1125 1125,1215 1215,1305
something? Are we in the

0,195 195,360 360,660 660,975 975,1185
the right chord tones with

that?|

0,245 245,395 395,530 530,695 695,950
When you're playing, your patterns

0,315 315,435 435,600 600,735 735,855

a finger pattern.|

0,180 180,405 405,675 675,930 930,1155
going through it, but basically

585
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:07,105
0,255 255,360 360,465 465,570 570,750
it's just a lot of

0,210 210,755 1045,1350 1350,1590 1590,1845
sheer repetition and getting better

0,120 120,360 360,710 1360,1950 1950,2115
not about speed, complexity or

599
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,190
0,210 210,495 495,845 955,1290 1290,1455
doing finger patterns. It's about

A little bit goes a

607
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,400

0,360 360,480 480,690 690,945 945,1155
It's the knowing what to

611
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,070

0,210 210,530
down low.|

0,320 460,780 780,840 840,900 900,960
time. Let's see if we

621
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,230
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,420 420,570

0,590 910,1310 1330,1590 1590,1800 1800,1995
soloing techniques that we've learned

623
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:03,905
0,335 385,705 705,1025 1315,1560 1560,1680
about into action. {So,this -}

624
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:04,490

0,180 180,500 640,990 990,1230 1230,1455
lot of listening to tracks

626

0,180 180,300 300,435 435,570 570,705
and you try and play

0,150 150,300 300,435 435,555 555,690
to try and pick out

0,120 120,420 420,540 540,690 690,855
a melody as we {go,through

00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:14,080
0,225 225,360 360,510 510,1025 1105,1835
makes a good solo melody?|

633

0,240 240,480 480,675 675,915 915,1185
play, not just playing finger

635
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,320
0,320
patterns.|

636
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,745
0,290 290,545 545,1040 1040,1220 1220,1325
Speed and complexity don't make

637
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:22,100
0,135 135,300 300,815
a good solo.|

0,225 225,495 495,675 675,840 840,1050
some ideas from that? We're

647
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,030
0,90 90,210 210,345 345,540 540,765
