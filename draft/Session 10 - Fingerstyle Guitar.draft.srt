0,360 360,690 690,900 900,2190 2190,2250
finger picking I'm going to

0,630 810,1080 1080,1260 1260,1320 1320,1470
patterns as well we're going

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,340
0,60 60,180 180,360 360,660 660,1140
to talk about merle travis

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,600

style guitar, a very popular

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,830
0,300 300,660 660,960 960,1020 1020,1230
a country style, I'm sure

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,850
0,150 150,660 660,720 720,930 930,1020
you'll recognize it once we

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,320
0,270
start.|

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,160
0,390 390,660 660,840 1230,1470 1470,1710
Getting into it we're going

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,640
0,60 60,180 180,240 240,390 390,480
to talk a little bit

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,140
0,210 210,690 690,1260 1260,1440 1440,1500
about classical guitar and the

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,160
0,450 450,570 570,690 690,900 900,1020
techniques that you use for

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,750
0,300 810,1020 1020,1080 1080,1350 1350,1590
that in the guitar tip

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,280
0,390 390,510 510,690 690,1170 1230,1530
section we're gonna cover how

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,570
0,90 90,270 270,1050 1050,1170 1170,1290
to get control of your

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,720
0,540 810,1830 1950,2340 2340,3030 3030,3150
playing speed versus control the

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,620
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,630 630,900
only way you can get

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,840
0,720
speed.|

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,140
0,300 300,510 510,990 990,1050 1050,1110
Is through control, so we're

27
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,830
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,480 480,690
going to talk about that,

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,700
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,450 450,840
so I hope you're ready

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:18,420
0,210 210,330 330,960 1290,5070
let's go and get.|

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,570
0,420 840,960 960,1140 1140,1380 1380,1650
Okay, let's talk about finger

31
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,430
0,300 300,870 990,1140 1140,1470 1470,1860
style guitar and finger picking

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,920
0,360 360,600 600,1650 1920,2100 2100,2280
we use arpeggios um, which

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,850
0,120 120,150 150,330 330,690 690,930
is a new term for

34
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,930
0,30 30,180 180,690 690,900 900,1080
a new concept for you

35
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,940
0,240 240,330 330,990 990,1380 1470,1770
all in arpeggio is we've

36
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,700
0,180 180,270 270,990 1080,2220 2220,2760
done our chords d chord,

37
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,390
0,210 210,300 300,420 420,600 600,660
let's say I'm doing A

38
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,330
0,300 300,750 780,2040 2130,2430 2430,2940
G chord okay all arpeggio

39
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,320
0,270 270,360 360,600 600,900 900,990
is I take notes of

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,460
0,180 180,540 540,810 810,870 870,1140
those chords instead of playing

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,370
0,1830 1830,2280 2280,2580 2580,2700 2700,2910
altogether I break them up

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,300
0,2250 2880,3090 3090,3270 3270,3510 3510,3780
I was A G chord

43
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:54,200
0,240 240,1590 1590,2490 3570,6150 6300,6870
like zero, so when I

44
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,020
0,1410 1410,1530 1530,2190 2190,2460 2460,2550
was a rpg that are

45
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:05,600
0,180 180,690 780,4590 4620,8160 8160,8580
using arpeggios like zach {geo's

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
0,270 390,1020
-} now.|

47
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,050
0,150 150,300 300,360 360,540 540,780
In order to get good

48
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,490
0,270 270,690 690,1230 1230,1380 1380,1440
finger style technique, there's a

49
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,270
0,270 270,510 510,570 570,690 690,780
couple things we need to

50
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,600
0,300 300,540 540,630 630,960
always keep in mind.|

51
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,030
0,270 270,360 360,600 600,1050 1050,1320
And it all starts with

52
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,760
0,210 210,600 600,1200 1230,1920 1920,2730
some very key right-hand concepts,

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,510 510,840
we're going to be mainly

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,850
0,300 300,450 450,690 690,1170 1650,2130
dealing with this hand, um,

55
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,740
0,270 270,420 420,780 780,1290 1590,1830
for this session today, so

56
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,850
0,270 270,420 420,570 570,690 690,1110
here's how you can start

57
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,930
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,780 780,1050
to have a good right

58
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,970
0,300 300,900 990,1230 1230,1470 1680,2040
hand position when you're starting

59
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,140
0,300 300,570 570,930
finger style stuff.|

60
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,980
0,150 150,420 420,510 510,600 600,720
The first thing you need

61
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,670
0,60 60,240 240,330 330,420 420,690
to have is a very

62
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,320
0,690 690,1290
relaxed hand.|

63
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,510
0,390 420,690 690,810 810,840 840,900
Okay, so how are we

64
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,500
0,180 180,330 330,690 690,810 810,990
gonna do that I want

65
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,550
0,90 90,300 300,510 510,630 630,1050
you just take your hand,

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,720
0,360 360,510 510,840 840,1020 1020,1080
take your arm put it

67
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,1020
down to your side.|

68
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,280
0,240 240,690 690,1230 1500,1770 1770,2040
Just completely relaxing your hand

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,380
0,420 420,960 1200,1350 1350,1830 1860,2100
normally comes to this kind

70
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,360
0,90 90,360 600,1020 1020,1410 1410,1980
of a sea looking shape,

71
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,500
0,540
okay.|

72
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,190
0,180 180,360 360,570 570,960 960,1200
And with that shape just

73
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,820
0,120 120,300 300,450 450,570 570,630
like that just kind of

74
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,510
0,210 210,360 360,480 480,570 570,690
bring that up to your

75
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,420
0,570
guitar.|

76
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,290
0,360 360,480 480,780 780,1050 1050,1260
This is actually let's say

77
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,670
0,360 360,480 480,840 840,1200 1200,1380
it's the zero point of

78
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,130
0,390 690,1530 1740,2100 2100,2220 2220,2460
your muscles there's two kinds

79
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,970
0,60 60,420 420,570 570,750 750,840
of muscles that run in

80
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,200
0,120 120,330 330,600 600,810 810,1230
your hand, actually three kinds

81
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,180
0,360 360,690 930,1410 1530,1710 1710,1800
but there's the two that

82
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,780
0,60 60,180 180,240 240,390 390,600
we're going to talk about

83
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,950
0,480 540,750 750,930 930,1050 1050,1170
today the ones that run

84
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,120
0,120 120,480 480,690 690,810 810,1170
on top when I flex

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,920
0,570
those.|

86
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,580
0,180 180,450 450,750 750,1200
My finger goes up.|

87
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,540
0,240 240,330 330,660 660,750 750,960
When I flex the ones

88
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,070
0,120 120,300 300,930 1050,1230 1230,1530
that run underneath my finger

89
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,720
0,270 270,690 1020,1230 1230,1590 1590,1650
goes in so actually the

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,790
0,420 420,1020 1260,1380 1380,1590 1590,2070
zero position is this rather

91
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,590
0,330 330,690 690,960 960,1140 1140,1440
see looking form right here,

92
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,670
0,480 480,630 630,750 750,870 870,930
that's where you want to

93
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,510
0,390 390,510 510,630 630,720 720,840
start at, you don't want

94
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,430
0,60 60,450 450,690 930,1140 1140,1920
to start at an uncomfortable

95
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,110
0,600 600,1140 1140,1290 1290,1440 1440,1680
stressful position or you'll never

96
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,100
0,270 270,390 390,810 810,930 930,990
get the concepts that we're

97
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,210
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,660 900,1110
going to talk about, so

98
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,980
0,240 240,420 420,900 900,1290 1650,1770
take that relaxed hand, go

99
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,700
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,660 660,720
ahead, put it up to

100
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,960
0,120 120,720 900,1020 1020,1110 1110,1260
your strings and I've got

101
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,860

And the third finger.|

119
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,220

0,270 270,450 570,810 810,900 900,1200
Got it, so we're dealing

121
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,210
0,120 120,240 240,600 600,1080 1440,1590
with the six string the

122
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,460
0,390 390,900 1200,1290 1290,1710 1710,2250
third string, the second string

124
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,410
0,240 240,240 870,1380 1380,1560 1560,1950
as I fire, my fingers

125
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,820
0,180 180,240 240,420 420,1050 1050,1410
think of your fingers firing

126
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,840
0,150 150,210 210,720
like a piston.|

127
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,740
0,270 270,450 450,690 690,960 960,1200
As each one goes goes

128
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,060
0,180 180,330 330,1020
through its movements.|

129
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,850
0,510 510,660 660,750 750,930 930,1380
You want to have freedom

130
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,350
0,180 180,750 1020,1200 1200,1380 1380,1500
of motion now look what

131
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,640
0,90 90,270 270,330 330,660 1110,1290
I had to do I

132
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,720
0,270 270,450 450,690 690,780 780,1080
have to kind of bring

133
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,090
0,150 150,450 450,1350 1410,1770 1770,2370
my thumb forward just slightly

134
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,200
0,180 180,330 330,750 750,960 960,1020
and my wrist out if

135
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,860
0,60 60,150 150,300 300,420 420,660
you don't want your wrist

136
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,970
0,300 300,390 390,540 540,750 750,1110
back in there like this,

137
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,810
0,240 240,360 360,480 480,540 540,660
you don't want to be

138
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,640
0,210 210,510
like that.|

139
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,980
0,150 150,480 510,660 660,1020 1020,1110
You may be tempted to

140
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,060
0,210 210,450 450,690 690,810 810,1080
do that because you think

141
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,840
0,210 210,420 420,480 480,660 660,780
you kind of need, all

142
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,800
0,180 180,540 540,600 600,750 750,960
that pressure to do that

143
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,880
0,330 330,390 390,660 660,780 780,870
actually the best thing to

144
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,530
0,360 600,780 780,990 990,1320 1320,1650
do bring that wrist out,

145
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,940
0,90 90,240 240,510 510,900 900,1410
and that thumb forward slightly

146
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,960
0,270 270,360 360,420 420,570 570,870
doesn't need to be way

147
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,530
0,120 120,180 180,390 390,510 510,570
out of here out of

148
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,090
0,360 450,840 840,1230 1230,1380 1380,1560
whack, just forward a little

149
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,040
0,150 150,690
bit slightly.|

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,660
0,540 720,990 990,1140 1140,1200 1200,1320
Okay, and now we're going

151
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,980
0,120 120,480 480,1020
to fire all.|

152
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,630

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,870
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,510 510,840
this is going to sound

189
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,820
0,240 240,390 390,840 840,1350 1530,1950
dumb, if anybody's listening over

0,90 90,240 240,360 360,450 450,570
is not going to make

193
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,360
0,150 150,450 450,510 510,630 630,720
much sense to them, it's

194
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,110
0,210 210,360 360,540 540,660 660,750

0,270 270,660 720,990 990,1170 1170,1350
making noise but don't worry

196
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,660
0,240 240,510 630,870 870,1140 1140,1200

0,360 360,570 570,660 660,870 870,1110
fingers until we start asking

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,780
0,540
chord.|

394
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,090

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,010
0,480 750,840 840,1020 1020,1380 1410,1620
well, it would then the

400
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,700
0,180 180,300 300,390 390,480 480,690
thumb would have to cover

401
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,010
0,210 210,750 840,1440 1440,1800 1800,2310
both spots from two thumb

402
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,620
0,960 1950,2220 2220,2340 2340,2400 2400,2610
three see what I did

403
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,020
0,390 450,1410 1440,2190 2220,3360 4380,5400
there thumb to thumb thumb

404
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,260
0,990 1020,1980 2610,2790 2790,3000 3000,3210
to thumb, he's just pulling

405
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,280
0,300 300,540 540,720 720,900 900,1020
double duty now that we're

406
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,060
0,210 210,270 270,600
using a pick.|

407
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:35,860
0,3180 9180,10170 10170,10590 10590,12030
Zoom zoom, three sorry.|

408
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,590
0,1800 2280,2520 2520,2730 2730,2820 2820,3060
So you can't do finger

409
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,640
0,210 210,450 450,570 570,690 690,1050
style stuff with your pick,

410
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,390
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,480 480,720
you just need to figure

411
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:42,870
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,420 420,480
out how you're going to

412
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,710
0,180 180,390 390,630 630,690 690,840
do that in a little

413
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,640
0,90 90,150 150,600 600,780 780,930
bit of practice with it,

414
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,690
0,360 390,570 570,630 630,750 750,810
OK, now we're going to

415
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,830
0,120 120,300 300,390 390,660 660,1140
talk about the merle travis

416
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,390
0,480 510,660 660,990 990,1200 1200,1560
style of picking merle travis

417
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,590
0,90 90,150 150,540 540,840 840,1200
was a great country guitar

418
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,390
0,360 540,810 810,1050 1050,1470 1470,1800
player for many years gone

419
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,920
0,420 450,660 660,810 810,1020 1020,1530
by, but he really developed

420
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,120
0,150 150,420 420,780 780,870 870,1200
this whole style of picking

421
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,110
0,150 150,360 360,570 570,630 630,990
now I like to use

422
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,700
0,270 270,540 540,870 1200,1410 1410,1560
a thumb pick, this is

423
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,470
0,240 240,570 570,1080 1170,1470 1470,1770
a Fred kelly thumb pick

424
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,880
0,360 360,780 780,1110 1110,1320 1320,1410
nothing particularly special about it,

425
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,840
0,120 120,210 210,480 480,690 690,960
there are other thumb picks

426
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,070
0,120 120,510 720,960 960,1110 1110,1230
as well to do it,

427
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,760
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,510 510,690
but in order to use

428
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,750
0,150 150,510 510,690 690,930 930,990
this style, it's good to

429
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,910
0,180 180,270 270,540 540,870 1170,2160
have a thumb pick, um,

430
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,930
0,420 420,540 540,720 720,780 780,930
because you kind of need

431
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,890
0,120 120,540 540,630 630,900 900,960
to angle it down a

432
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,680
0,150 150,300 300,720
little bit different.|

433
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,430
0,510 630,900 900,1080 1080,1170 1170,1350
Okay, so let me just

434
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,510
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,780 780,1080
play a little bit for

435
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,310
0,270 600,1020 1050,1470 1470,1680 1680,1800
you, um using it, and

436
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,210
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,390 390,900
then I'll kind of describe

437
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,500
0,180 180,540 630,1140 1440,1980
what I'm doing okay.|

438
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:55,420
0,4020 6270,17850 19260,26400 30180,34950
Za za za za.|

439
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,300
0,90 90,300 300,450 450,540 540,780
Now that kind of a

440
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,310
0,360 360,1170 1170,1230 1230,1830 1830,1890
boom chick a kind of

441
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,450
0,330 330,690 690,810 810,900 900,1140
a picking where you're hitting

442
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,590
0,90 90,480 480,810 810,990 990,1140
the bass notes and then

443
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,510
0,60 60,630 660,990 990,1560 1590,1920
the cord chet atkins did

444
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,200
0,180 180,210 210,480 480,570 570,690
that a lot, it was

445
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,460
0,90 90,360 360,450 450,660 660,1260
all started with merle travis.|

446
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,670
0,360 360,450 450,570 570,660 660,870
What you need to do

447
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,980
0,120 120,330 330,900 1170,1830 2130,2310
for this technique is you

448
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,790
0,150 150,240 240,420 420,480 480,810
have to kind of angle

449
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,540
0,270 270,270 270,600 600,660 660,750
remember I told you how

450
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,460
0,270 270,390 390,750 840,1140 1140,1920
you should have your handout,

451
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,990
0,390 420,780 780,960 960,1080 1080,1290
well forget that on this

452
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,460
0,510 690,870 870,1080 1080,1200 1200,1470
technique you bring your hand,

453
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,390
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,810 810,930
you put your palm, this

454
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,320
0,150 150,210 210,300 300,750 780,930
part of your palm on

455
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,940
0,90 90,690 690,780 780,960 960,1620
the backside of your string.|

456
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,080
0,360 360,600 930,1350 1350,1590 1590,1680
For the bass notes and

457
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,710
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,450 450,630
it kind of gets this

458
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,300
0,390 390,750 3120,4050 4050,4320 4320,4590
muted sound, now it's just

459
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,650
0,120 120,210 210,570 570,930 930,1350
on the top few strings,

460
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,030
0,90 90,330 330,750 840,1230 1230,1380
the bass strings while the

461
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,460
0,270 270,540 540,1170
ones down here.|

462
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,110
0,150 150,420 420,630 630,720 720,960
Are still able to play

463
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:41,340
0,90 90,630 6540,6900 6900,7140 7140,7230
the chord, so it's a

464
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,240
0,180 180,330 330,660 660,750 750,900
little bit tricky to get

465
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,320
0,360 360,600 600,720 720,780 780,1080
started, you have to angle

466
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,040
0,90 90,330 330,390 390,540 540,720
your hand a little bit

467
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,850
0,300 360,480 480,600 600,660 660,810
down I'm going to give

468
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,050
0,60 60,90 90,480 480,1080 1080,1200
you a simple exercise to

469
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,550
0,150 150,600 600,810 810,930 1170,1500
get started with it, okay,

470
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,420
0,300 300,420 420,570 570,750 750,840
we're just gonna try and

471
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,490
0,120 120,210 210,690 690,1410 1620,2070
get the notes first, okay.|

472
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,210
0,240 240,330 330,480 480,1050 1050,1320
Here we go, exercise one

473
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,180
0,90 90,210 210,660
in your book.|

474
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,210
0,750 990,1530 1680,2250 3930,4410 4410,4590
Ready and go and you're

475
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,530
0,330 330,480 480,570 570,1380 2970,4320
looking for the correct sound,

476
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,750
0,120 120,780 990,1440 1740,2130 2130,2220
you're playing, you want the

477
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,240
0,360 360,630 630,1080 1080,1320 1320,2490
note kinda choked off a

478
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,330
0,5130 5220,5400 5400,5640 5640,5700 5700,5850
OK may take a little

479
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,230
0,150 150,210 210,630 630,750 750,900
bit of practice to get

480
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,550
0,210 210,270 270,360 360,750 780,1320
that in the right spot

481
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,780
0,180 180,420 420,780 780,870 870,960
where it's giving you the

482
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,310
0,240 240,630 810,1140 1140,1350 1350,1530
right sound, now let's add

483
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,270
0,90 90,270 270,390 390,480 480,960
a little bit of chords

484
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,440
0,180 180,300 510,900 930,1110 1110,1170
with it okay so it

485
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,220
0,300 300,360 360,450 450,510 510,780
starts out on A C

486
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,850
0,300 300,360 360,480 480,540 540,630
chord, I'm going to do

487
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,020
0,120 120,480 480,810 810,1110 1110,1170
my base notes but I'm

488
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,740
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,420 420,720
going to play the top

489
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,430
0,60 60,120 120,330 330,570 570,690
of the c chord with

490
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,600
0,240 240,480 480,1080
these three fingers.|

491
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,650
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,450 450,570
Let's see if we can

492
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,850
0,120 120,600 780,990 990,1110 1110,1200
do this I'll do it

493
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,320
0,270 270,390 390,840 1200,1350 1350,1470
nice and slow, this is

494
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,220
0,570 570,960 1050,1710 2100,2640
exercise to ready go.|

495
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:53,680
0,8790
ZA.|

496
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,500
0,300 420,540 540,690 690,1050 1050,1260
Hey, now you slowly build

497
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,910
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,930 930,1410
more and more complex patterns

498
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,470
0,180 180,330 540,840 840,1170 1170,1560
on it throw different chords

499
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,670
0,210 210,300 300,420 420,660 660,1200
into it but that's basically

500
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,350
0,210 210,510 510,720 720,900 1290,1680
what's going on there takes

501
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,610
0,120 120,360 360,510 510,570 570,1260
a little bit of sitting

502
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,150
0,120 120,240 240,630 630,1080 3300,3540
in your room going to

503
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,290
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,930 930,1140
actually get the flow of

504
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,430
0,240 3330,3600 3600,3690 3690,3900 3900,4140
it once you do it's

505
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,690
0,60 60,450 450,900 900,1170 1170,1260
a very rewarding style to

506
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,410
0,210 210,360 360,480 480,660 660,720
play because you're kind of

507
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,820
0,600 600,1110 1110,1230 1230,1350 1350,1410
accompanying yourself you've got a

508
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,260
0,570 570,870 960,1200 1200,1380 1380,1440
baseline going, you've got the

509
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,670
0,420 420,780 870,1020 1020,1140 1140,1410
cords going, you can also

510
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,780
0,150 150,240 240,540 540,690 690,1110
throw a melody on top

511
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,040
0,210 210,300 300,360 360,780 810,1230
so it's a very um.|

512
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,740
0,570 570,660 660,870 870,1260 1260,1350
Interesting and fun technique to

513
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,460
0,240 240,360 360,420 420,660 660,720
play, so I encourage you

514
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,340
0,90 90,270 270,420 420,510
to work on it.|

515
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,140
0,240 240,390 390,660 660,870 870,1320
Now you'll notice I'm switching

516
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,970
0,330 330,900 900,1110 1110,1650 1650,1830
between guitar, some guitars lend

517
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,890
0,420 420,780 780,1230 1260,1530 1590,1920
themselves better to a steel

518
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,360
0,180 180,660 660,840 840,1200 1200,1470
string guitars lend themselves better

519
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,000
0,300 360,750 750,1200 1200,1590 1860,2640
to rural travis stuff and

520
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,930
0,180 180,240 240,300 300,450 450,900
some of the other finger

521
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,090
0,540 1230,1650 1650,1740 1740,1860 1860,2100
style techniques that we've talked

522
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,020
0,210 360,600 600,660 660,750 750,930
about going to talk about

523
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,340
0,450 450,750 750,810 810,990 990,1320
classical guitar a little while

524
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,480
0,300 300,390 390,450 450,630 630,1050
I had to take classical

525
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,940
0,450 450,660 660,1380 1530,2250 2250,2460
guitar in college and at

526
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,870
0,240 240,330 330,540 540,840 840,930
first I thought gosh it's

527
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,400
0,240 360,840 840,1110 1110,1200 1200,1530
the biggest waste of time,

528
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,270
0,90 90,420 420,600 600,690 690,870
it actually ended up being

529
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,410
0,120 120,180 180,240 240,510 510,1140
one of the most helpful

530
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,790
0,540 540,660 660,720 720,990 990,1320
skills that I now use

531
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,300
0,270 270,780 780,1290
as a player.|

532
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,910
0,420 420,570 570,750 750,960 960,1230
So we're talking about hand

533
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,140
0,390 390,540 540,630 630,960 960,1230
position, that's the first thing.|

534
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,150
0,390 390,990 1410,1650 1650,1860 1860,2160
Again relaxed put that hand

535
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,190
0,420 420,480 480,660 660,1050 1470,2040
forward a little bit okay,

536
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,080
0,840 840,960 960,1110 1110,1350
and you want to.|

537
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,460
0,780 780,840 840,1110 1110,1380 1380,1410
Let me mention something a

538
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,080
0,180 180,270 270,780 1080,1410 1410,1620
little bit about taking care

539
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,390
0,90 90,210 210,810 1080,1590 2040,2310
of your nails on on

540
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,500
0,240 240,570 570,690 690,900 900,1110
one hand I don't have

541
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,850
0,600 630,810 810,900 900,1170 1170,1350
nails on my left hand

542
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,840
0,60 60,270 270,450 450,870 870,990
I don't have nails on

543
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,220
0,120 120,390 390,720 960,1230 1230,1380
my right hand although it's

544
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,990
0,300 570,1110 1110,1470 1470,1620 1620,1770
not huge nails, I've got

545
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,620
0,30 30,180 180,300 300,360 360,630
a little bit of nails

546
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,700
0,60 60,210 210,450 570,840 840,1080
on this hand, it helps

547
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,720
0,90 90,270 270,540 540,690 690,1020
to give you the finger

548
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,520
0,330 330,570 570,990 990,1440 1470,1800
style right cyrus sound, if

549
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,710
0,150 150,390 510,930 1080,2070 2070,2190
you get to grow your

550
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,940
0,270 270,450 450,840 840,990 990,1230
nails out just a little

551
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,540
0,210 210,300 300,390 390,540 540,600
bit, you don't need to

552
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,830
0,120 120,390 390,750 810,1200 1200,1290
be really long just a

553
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,180
0,210 210,450 540,900 930,1260 1260,1350
little bit is enough to

554
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,810

0,300 300,750 750,840 840,960 960,1050
The emphasis is on a

557
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,000
0,360 390,1080 1080,1410 1410,1980 2190,2550

is the right hand studies

563

0,360 360,540 540,1020 1050,1320 1320,1620
all it does is takes

568
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,250
0,180 570,810 810,870 870,1110 1110,1410
you from A C chord

Okay, so let's start with

and goes several different ways

586
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,650

0,240 240,390 390,750 750,870 870,960
right hand studies are the

594
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,300
0,270 270,360 360,420 420,540 540,870
best way to get started

595
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,800
0,90 90,330 540,1290 1290,1380 1380,1500
with that control is the

596
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,480
0,240 240,570
main thing.|

597
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,870
0,240 240,330 330,600 600,870 870,1170
In our guitar tips section

598
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,190
0,60 60,210 210,630 810,1230 1230,1320
we're gonna cover getting the

599
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,870
0,450 450,600 600,1140 1380,1530 1530,1680
control you need to be

600
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,430
0,90 90,810 810,1080 1080,1290 1290,1560
a fantastic finger style player

601
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,600
0,690 690,750 750,900 900,1020 1020,1170
that I know you want

602
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,830
0,60 60,360 780,1020 1020,1080 1080,1230
to be and we're going

603
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,760
0,60 60,180 180,450 450,780 780,930
to talk about building up

604
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,840
0,510 570,750 750,840 840,990 990,1080
speed, so I'll see you

605
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,400
0,270
there.|

606
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,080
0,420 630,960 960,1020 1020,1110 1110,1440
Okay, welcome to the guitar

607
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,030
0,360 360,840 1230,1590 1590,1650 1650,1950
tips section there's a couple

608
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,560
0,90 90,420 420,780 780,1110 1110,1530
of things for key things

609
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,540
0,270 270,660 990,1560 1560,1830 1830,1980
I think will help you

610
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,710
0,180 180,300 300,570 570,840 840,1170
be the finger style player

611
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,640
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,510 510,930
that you need to become

612
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,290
0,330 780,1140 1140,1320 1320,1470 1470,1620
and having done this for

613
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,460
0,300 300,390 390,630 630,720 720,1170
years and years and years.|

614
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,110
0,510 660,990 990,1080 1080,1470 1470,1950
Um, these are four critical

615
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,790
0,540 960,1230 1230,1380 1380,1500 1500,1680
things that you can do

616
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,260
0,120 120,690 690,840 840,1170 1170,1470
to improve your finger style

617
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,610
0,450 480,690 690,780 780,930 930,1350
playing as you get started

618
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,180
0,120 120,240
in it.|

619
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,800
0,570 570,1110
Number one.|

620
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,430
0,600 600,1350 1380,1620 1620,1710 1710,2430
Always practice with a metronome.|

621
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,470
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,1080 1080,1650
I've got my metronome handy

622
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,660
0,300 300,690
right here.|

623
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,920
0,360 360,540 540,780 780,990 990,1740
As I'm doing these studies.|

624
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,190
0,270 270,690 690,930 930,1020 1020,1080
I started off at a

625
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,240
0,780
tempo.|

626
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,450
0,420 420,1080 1260,1500 1500,1620 1620,1950
You're tempted as you're starting

627
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,800
0,90 90,630
to play.|

628
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,070
0,150 150,360 360,540 540,960 960,1050
To get real woefully on

629
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,990
0,90 90,600 630,780 780,1320 1320,1920
the tempo a metronome forces

630
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,250
0,150 150,210 210,780 990,1170 1170,1260
you to play in the

631
00:21:53,250 --> 00:22:07,580
0,390 540,3540
right tempo.|

632
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,120
0,2490 2760,3270 3780,4020 4020,4110 4110,4260
Then, then when I'm ready

633
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,290
0,90 90,570 600,750 750,1080 1080,1170
to go I speed it

634
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:25,560
0,150 150,1380 1440,2370 2400,6330 8550,12270
up a bit zen za.|

635
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,440
0,450 660,1020 1020,1170 1170,1200 1200,1620
Now working with a metronome

636
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,030
0,120 120,480 480,900 1170,1440 1440,1590
is never fun, it's not

637
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,290
0,180 180,300 300,690 750,1050 1080,1260
fun for me but I've

638
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,130
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,600 630,840
got to do it and

639
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,690
0,60 60,360 360,570 570,900 900,1560
in almost every studio situation,

640
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,640
0,240 240,480 480,750 1170,1710 1710,1950
I've been in almost all

641
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,930
0,90 90,390 660,870 870,1050 1050,1290
of them, you have some

642
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,730
0,180 180,240 240,330 330,1080 1200,1800
sort of a metronome going

643
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,170
0,690 690,780 780,900 900,1050 1050,1140
{metronome's -} are what the

644
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,420
0,420 420,870 1200,1590 1620,1890 1890,2250
pros use to get their

645
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,600
0,810 810,1200 1200,1620 1620,2310 2400,3120
tempos and and fingering steady

646
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,840
0,210 210,300 300,720 720,960
so I'd encourage you.|

647
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,220
0,630 630,900 900,1560 1560,1770 1770,2130
Um, it's frustrating you bet

648
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,420
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,810 810,930
but it's the way to

649
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,350
0,390 420,570 570,690 690,870 870,930
go, if you want to

650
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,510
0,360 390,1230 1230,1410 1410,2040 2040,2160
get speed and control of

651
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,580
0,150 150,720 1080,1440 1500,1950 1950,2070
your finger, okay, you may

652
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,450
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,750 750,870
be the one thinking that

653
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,830
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,660 1020,1380
you don't need it, but.|

654
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,260
0,180 180,330 330,390 390,540 540,810
I'll tell you from someone

655
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,160
0,120 120,330 330,510 510,780 780,900
who's done it you're going

656
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,750
0,60 60,150 150,210 210,780 1170,1590
to need a metronome number

657
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,510
0,420 690,1140 1140,1680 1890,2220 2220,2760
two for a your fingering

658
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,480
0,690
style.|

659
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,240
0,450 480,1140
A technique.|

660
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,100
0,540 540,960 1350,2640 2670,3510
Number two slow down.|

661
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,950
0,510 510,840 840,1050 1050,1170 1170,1470
Everybody always wants to go

662
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,150
0,750 750,1020 1020,3840 3840,4080 4080,4200
fast and z next thing

663
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,050
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,690 690,900
you know they're tripping all

664
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,370
0,180 180,690 690,810 810,1110 1110,1320
over themselves, they can't do

665
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,290
0,240 240,480 480,690 690,1170 1230,1620
their hand gets tense, they

666
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,050
0,840 840,1170 1170,2340 2370,5580 5580,5670
started slow {tempo's -} and

667
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,770
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,600 600,720
next thing you know they

668
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,820
0,180 180,240 240,420 420,960 960,1050
want to go fast, they

669
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,410
0,210 210,270 270,630 690,1320 1320,1590
want to be Mr hot

670
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,790
0,360 390,570 570,660 660,990 990,1380
shot and they don't learn

671
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,820
0,60 60,840
the technique.|

672
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,550
0,390 390,570 570,1020 1020,1110 1110,1500
So my advice to you

673
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,460
0,270 270,1200 1260,1830 1860,2130 2130,2730
is slow down how slow

674
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,230
0,450 450,900 900,1050 1050,1410 1410,1590
as stink and slow as

675
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,580
0,150 150,390 390,510 510,1050 1200,1350
you need to go to

676
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,400
0,300 300,450 450,1470 1920,2550 2550,2820
get your fingers doing what

677
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,500
0,150 150,1110 1110,1290 1290,1770 1770,2100
your brain is telling them

678
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,400
0,180 180,1440
to do.|

679
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,420
0,570 570,840 840,1290 1290,1410 1410,1650
Yes, it's hard it takes

680
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,250
0,60 60,360 360,480 480,1230 1710,1830
a lot of thought to

681
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,330
0,210 210,330 330,720 720,900 900,1080
get your fingers doing what

682
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,140
0,120 120,330 330,420 420,690 690,810
they need to do but

683
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,280
0,180 180,660 660,900 900,990 990,1140
it's only when you do

684
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,080
0,120 120,900 1110,1260 1260,1470 1470,1800
it slow that you're actually

685
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,730
0,510 510,660 660,1110 1350,1560 1560,1650
training your hand if you

686
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,660
0,210 210,510 510,630 630,810 810,930
keep bumping your head up

687
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,790
0,300 300,360 360,1230 1320,2070 2070,2130
against the wall trying to

688
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,320
0,120 120,210 210,930 1230,1440 1440,1530
do it fast, you can

689
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,310
0,150 150,390 390,540 540,900 900,990
do that, for years and

690
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,630
0,180 180,330 330,510 510,960 1110,1320
never get any better, when

691
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,880
0,360 360,780 780,1470 1500,1890 1890,2250
actually doing slow few minutes

692
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,570

698
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,480
0,120 120,180 180,240 240,510 510,750
one of the best things

699
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,770
0,180 180,600 660,960 960,1200 1200,1290
I learned was getting a

700
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,660

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,620
0,120 120,390 390,600 600,870 870,960
your hand way far in

702
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,240

0,420 420,450 450,660 660,1050 1200,1560
forward a little bit not

704
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,360
0,150 150,660 990,1260 1260,1320 1320,1560
too much, just a little

705
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,550
0,300 750,1380 1380,1680 1680,2010 2010,2190
bit relax, that wrist as

706
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,380
0,180 180,510 510,870 990,1560 1560,1830
you speed up don't tense

707
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,220
0,150 150,300 300,570 570,720 720,840
up your hand that's going

708
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,180
0,60 60,210 210,360 360,810 810,960
to be your tenancy, you're

709
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,020
0,150 150,360 360,420 420,720 720,840
gonna want to tense up

710
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,830
0,180 180,420 420,510 510,600 600,810
that hand as you're getting

711
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,750
0,390 390,480 480,960 1230,1710 1710,1920

00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,300
0,390
hand.|

713
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,440
0,360 360,630 630,780 780,870 870,1020
Your wrist needs to be

714
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,640
0,510 510,810 840,990 990,1080 1080,1200
slightly out you don't want

715
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,660
0,60 60,180 180,660 660,840 840,1020
to go flat with it

716
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,600
0,240 240,510
like that.|

717
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,050
0,420 540,1020 1020,1230 1230,1500 1500,1650
Not completely far out but

718
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,330
0,210 210,660 660,870 870,1350 1830,2280
just comfortable hand position, okay,

719
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,800
0,240 240,630 630,720 720,1020 1020,1410
the fourth and last thing

720
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,650
0,180 180,900 1230,1440 1440,2250 2430,2610
is practice and repetition, you

721
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,790
0,210 210,360 360,570 570,870 870,1140
don't get good finger style

722
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,920
0,630 960,1140 1140,1500 1500,1560 1560,2130
technique by trying it once.|

723
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,050
0,270 270,360 360,990 1080,1440 1440,1590
It's a technique that is

724
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,480
0,90 90,630 630,960 960,2160 2190,2430
a physical thing and it

725
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,120
0,330 330,780 840,1620 1650,2130 2130,2640
just takes sheer gun wrenching

726
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,080
0,810 2820,3150 3150,3480 3480,3780 3780,3960
repetition, so sit there with

727
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,000
0,90 90,420 420,1080 1590,1770 1770,1920
A D chord and do

728
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,160
0,270 270,1320 1320,1680 1680,1890 1890,2160
these exercises thumb two one

729
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,870
0,420 420,780 780,1080 1080,1350 1350,1710
three thumb one two three

730
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,720
0,300 300,570 570,750 750,1140 1530,2850
thumb three two one slow.|

731
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,560
0,900 900,1110 1140,2070 2070,2400 2550,3420
Over and over and over

732
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,360
0,360 360,660 660,870 870,1470 1470,1800
again until your mind just

733
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,070
0,540 540,750 750,840 840,1020 1020,1710
melts out of your ears,

734
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,220
0,2070 2130,2490 2490,2610 2610,2700 2700,3150
and then you can start

735
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,270
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,690 690,1050
doing it with your fingers

736
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,350
0,240 240,450 450,750 750,870 870,1080
start doing without you having

737
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,000
0,90 90,390 390,510 510,990 1410,1650
to think as much, so

738
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,170
0,180 180,630 630,750 750,810 810,1170
do it for a while,

739
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,980
0,180 180,360 360,570 570,690 690,810
then come back to it,

740
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,850
0,210 210,300 300,570 570,660 660,870
try it again, the whole

741
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,990
0,480 630,750 750,900 900,1020 1020,1140
idea is that you want

742
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,530
0,60 60,120 120,240 240,300 300,540
to be able to start

743
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,360
0,240 240,390 690,1320 1320,1590 1590,1830
doing it fast without having

744
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:46,320
0,150 150,360 360,660 3510,7500 7680,12960
to think about za zo,

745
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,670
0,150 150,480 480,870 870,1260 1260,1350
you maybe really lost in

746
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,710
0,180 450,870 870,1260 1260,1560 1560,2040
the thumb, one two three.|

747
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,430
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,540 540,660
Do it over and over

748
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,360
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,540 540,930
and over and over again,

749
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,680
0,120 120,870 870,990 990,1230 1230,1290
the repetition will start to

750
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,970
0,180 180,360 360,750 750,1140 1140,1290
make that second nature, and

751
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,170
0,60 60,150 150,450 450,540 540,1200
it will start to going

752
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,850
0,420 420,540 540,1110 1110,1170 1170,1320
running on autopilot to where

753
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,690
0,60 60,150 150,360 360,600 600,840
you can start thinking about

754
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,080
0,360 360,450 450,690 690,1020
chords and making music.|

755

Until you can play them

767
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,790

0,60 60,300 300,360 360,570 570,690
of starting to get out

0,60 60,690 780,1050 1050,1170 1170,1230
of control you want to

773
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,450
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,390 390,540

and evenly and last is

776
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,490
0,510 510,630 630,990 990,1620 1620,1860
practice, the song canon in

00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,800
0,240 240,630 630,960 960,1470 1620,2160
at pocket bells, canon canon

890
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,400
0,120 120,480
in d.|

891
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,380
0,300 300,480 480,570 570,690 690,840
I'll try and get through

892
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,220
0,120 120,420 420,570 570,660 660,840
as much of it as

893
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,030
0,120 120,360 360,570 570,690 690,810
we can here but you're

894
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,750
0,210 210,360 360,420 420,630 630,720
probably going to do a

895
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,650
0,180 180,330 330,420 420,720 720,900
good bit of work on

896
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,570
0,180 180,480 660,1230 1260,1620 1620,1920
your own okay, let's start

897
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,610
0,390 390,840 840,1200 1200,1500 1500,2040
it's mainly dealing with thumb

898
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,430
0,690 810,1380 1410,1830 1830,2040 2040,2520
one two three our first

899
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,380
0,450 450,930 1260,1770 1770,1860 1860,1950
fingering pattern starts on A

900
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,310
0,240 240,540 540,720 720,870 870,930
D chord goes through a

901
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,330
0,210 210,270 270,420 420,690 690,1020
lot of the open chords

902
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,800
0,90 90,270 270,630 840,1260 1260,1470
that we've already talked about

903
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,970
0,120 120,510 510,720 720,960 960,1170
as well as some of

904
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,020
0,120 120,420 420,810 810,930 930,1050
the barre chords so its

905
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,100
0,90 90,300 300,480 480,960 960,1080
a real good practice on

906
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,840
0,180 180,240 240,570
all of this.|

907
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,460
0,510 600,900 900,1140 1140,1290 1290,1380
Okay, let me let me

908
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,050
0,330 330,420 420,810 810,1110 1110,1590
crank the tempo down pretty

909
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,100
0,600
far.|

910
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,700
0,210 210,330 330,540 540,780 780,1200
Here we go, let's try

911
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:06,690
0,630 990,1590 1860,2400 3660,6600 7110,9960
one two ready go zen.|

912
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,540
0,2370 2370,2640 2640,2760 2760,3270 3270,3660
Okay, that's the first part

913
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,040
0,120 120,270 570,1080 1110,1440 1440,1500
of it okay, let me

914
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,970
0,270 270,330 330,480 480,570 570,930
speed it up a little

915
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,930
0,180 180,480 480,690 690,780 780,960
bit more just a little

916
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,550
0,150 150,510 1050,1200 1200,1320 1320,1620
bit more and we'll try

917
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,480
0,90 90,210 210,360 360,510 510,930
it a little bit faster

918
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,620
0,270 270,450 450,780 780,1020 1020,1140
during that first part, now

919
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,310
0,90 90,300 300,390 390,480 480,690
you also have A D

920
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:39,970
0,120 120,180 180,360 360,600 600,660
with an f sharp in

921
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,140
0,60 60,450 510,750 750,900 900,1170
the base, we haven't gotten

922
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,220
0,90 90,390 390,600 600,810 810,1080
to talking about those chords

923
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,630
0,300 330,600 600,900 900,1020 1020,1410
yet but here's the form

924
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,670
0,120 120,270 1320,1440 1440,1950 1950,2040
of it, it's basically A

925
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,780
0,210 210,720 810,900 900,990 990,1110
D chord and you have

926
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,800
0,150 150,420 420,780 780,900 900,1020
this f sharp with your

927
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,820
0,450 450,960
second finger.|

928
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,910
0,330 330,570 570,690 690,960 960,1320
Down there and that's what

929
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,870
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,840 840,960
gets that f sharp there

930
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,530
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,570 570,660
if you just follow the

931
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,520
0,480 480,600 600,780 780,870 870,990
tablature, I'll show you what

932
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
0,90 90,360 810,1050 1050,1110 1110,1440
to do here you go

go slowly and evenly za

935
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,680
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,2610
with an f sharp.|

936

00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,040
0,300 300,540 540,780 780,1320
Just turn this off.|

938
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,800
0,330 330,720 720,1200
That second part.|

939
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,360

00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,320
0,90 90,210 210,330 330,780 780,960
and you can practice on

941
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,220
0,210 210,510
your own.|

942
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,100

00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,980
0,510 720,1470 1500,1920 1920,2580 2730,2880
using thumb and third to

944
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,480
0,180 180,390 390,690 690,990 990,1500
get these first couple notes

945
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:48,060
0,1530 1530,5250 6150,7260 7380,7890 7890,8130

0,180 180,390 390,600 600,780 780,1470
it gets into some sixteenth

950
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,550
0,450 750,1200 1200,1440 1440,1590 1590,1770
notes, so it's gonna take

951
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,740
0,480 510,1140 1350,1830 1830,2070 2070,2190
a little working on it

952
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,000
