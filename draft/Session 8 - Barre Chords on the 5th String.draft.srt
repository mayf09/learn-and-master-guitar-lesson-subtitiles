Um, there are bar chords

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,740
0,90 90,330 330,630 630,720 720,1140

cover a couple of key

29
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,380
0,780 900,1380 1380,1530 1530,2190 2340,2640
concepts dealing with keys and

30
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,210
0,270 270,960 960,1200 1200,1320 1320,1830
key signatures how to determine

31
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,670
0,60 60,600 870,1710 1860,1920 1920,2460
the key how to how

32
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,110
0,120 120,540 540,690 690,1260 1260,1440
to drive that information from

33
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,280
0,90 90,390 390,870 900,1080 1080,1170
the major scale and then

34
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,780
0,90 90,420 420,840 840,1380 1380,1500
a very important information as

35
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,710
0,60 60,300 300,630 630,780 780,930
you begin playing with other

36
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,150
0,570 570,690 690,990 990,1080 1080,1440
musicians and playing in different

37
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,310
0,690 720,960 960,1140 1140,1260 1260,1950
settings is how to determine

38
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,410
0,300 300,1050 1110,1380 1380,1590 1590,1860
the key from just looking

39
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,310
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,510 510,900
at a piece of music

40
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,240
0,270 270,420 420,480 480,600 600,660
okay, so we're going to

41
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,140
0,150 150,330 330,630 630,810 810,900
learn that skill to a

42
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,160
0,270 270,330 330,630 630,750 750,1020
couple of tricks for that.|

43
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,920
0,300 300,540 540,960 960,1140 1140,1290
And that's basically all we're

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,270
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,990 990,1350

lots of exciting things to

46
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,490
0,240 240,390 390,600 600,690 690,810
learn this week as you

47
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,750
0,240 240,330 330,660 660,720 720,1260

0,420 420,690 690,1140 1560,3840 3840,6840
So I'll see zech zero.|

51
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,440
0,240 240,330 330,630 630,750 750,840
Okay, the first thing we

52
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,700
0,120 120,210 210,570 720,960 960,1260
need to do as we

53
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,690
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,600 600,960
as we need to cover

54
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,950
0,210 210,420 420,720 720,990 990,1260
these fifth string bar forms

55
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,610
0,120 120,300 300,420 420,480 480,660
that we're going to come

56
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,450
0,180 180,450 480,690 690,750 750,840
up on because we need

57
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,590
0,60 60,240 240,450 450,690 690,1140
to talk about hand position

58
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,780
0,270 270,480 480,1050 1440,1950 1950,2190
again just review proper hand

59
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,760
0,510 630,870 870,1320 1320,1830 1830,1980
position is so vital to

60
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,700
0,210 210,300 300,630
what we're doing.|

61
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,000
0,390 390,480 480,630 630,690 690,1200
What you need to remember

62
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,980
0,240 240,450 450,840 840,1230 1230,1950
keep that first finger straight,

63
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,140
0,540 540,780 780,1170 1170,1590 1620,1920
if you're angling back on

64
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,230
0,330 570,1770 1800,2910 2910,2970 2970,3090
you're a neck of your

65
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,550
0,330 330,540 540,900 930,1170 1170,1320
guitar like this you're not

66
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,810
0,330 330,420 420,540 540,630 630,1260
going to get the power

67
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,220
0,240 240,330 330,630 660,960 960,1260
that you need even though

68
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,090
0,210 210,510 510,600 600,810 810,840
you think you're getting a

69
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,290
0,180 180,360 360,450 450,930 960,1200
whole lot of power but

70
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,460
0,90 90,270 270,480 480,570 570,1170
you're not getting the power

71
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,720
0,330 330,480 480,900 900,1080 1080,1200
where you need which is

72
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,920
0,90 90,270 270,630 630,1050
in that first finger.|

73
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,280
0,300 300,480 480,660 660,930 930,1170
Make sure that first finger

74
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,320
0,120 120,690 690,810 810,1500 1620,2040
is nice and strong okay,

75
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,010
0,60 60,210 210,300 300,570 570,690
you need to take your

76
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,870
0,330 330,390 390,540 540,1110 1380,1860
finger to the gym for

77
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,490
0,180 180,420 420,1050 1110,1380 1380,1620
these little muscles by doing

78
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,500
0,210 210,540 540,1500 1560,1860 1860,2010
those finger exercises that's what

79
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,390
0,360 360,480 480,720 1140,1290 1290,1890
toughens them up and where

80
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,200
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,690 690,750
it can do what it

81
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,340
0,240 240,300 300,600 690,930 930,1140
needs to do you'll find

82
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,420
0,90 90,300 300,540 540,840 840,1080
that these fifth string bar

83
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,170
0,300 300,360 360,420 420,570 570,750
forms are a little bit

84
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,160
0,300 300,420 420,510 510,780 780,990
easier than the six string

85
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,180
0,240 240,450 450,540 540,690 690,1020
barre forms that we've covered

86
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,500
0,300 300,420 420,660 660,900 900,1080
make sure that risk is

87
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,380
0,720 810,1020 1020,1710
forward and lo.|

88
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,680
0,90 90,570 570,660 660,750 750,930
The temptation is to bring

89
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,090
0,120 120,510 630,840 840,1080 1080,1410
it back, you want it

90
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,040
0,600 810,1080 1080,1500 1500,1830 1830,1950
down not completely whacked out

91
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,480
0,120 120,840 870,1140 1140,1230 1230,1440
not uncomfortable, but it needs

92
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,230
0,90 90,240 240,480 480,570 570,750
to it needs to be

93
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,030
0,360 420,1050 1050,1470 1470,1650 1650,1800
good solid down when you're

94
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,920
0,990 1260,1440 1440,1620 1620,1680 1680,1890
playing to have a good

95
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,120
0,240 240,630 630,870 870,960 960,1200
hand position, remember your hand

96
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,770
0,390 390,630 630,900 900,1020 1020,1650
position should still be balanced

97
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,450
0,330 330,750 750,1050 1050,1230 1230,1380
our fingers even though we're

98
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,610
0,420 420,960 960,1560 1560,1860 1860,2160
playing barre chords, they still

99
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,020
0,210 210,330 330,630 630,900 1020,1410
should be coming at not

100
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,700
0,390 390,630 630,1080 1260,1410 1410,1680
angled like this, but coming

101
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,920
0,450 450,1140
straight on.|

102
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,180
0,420 420,720
Like that.|

103
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
0,630
Okay.|

104
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,850
0,600 660,1650 1650,1860 1860,2340 2340,2910
Now, when you move between

105
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,130
0,750 1350,1860 1860,1980 1980,2070 2070,2280
chords, let's say I'm going

106
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,180
0,150 150,240 240,540 540,960 960,1050
from A G chord to

107
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,100
0,120 120,360 360,1530 1560,1680 1680,1920
an a chord I don't

108
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,300
0,150 150,360 510,870 870,990 990,1200
want to make the g

109
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,090
0,390 390,540 540,1260 1290,2070 2070,2790
chord and then completely reset.|

110
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,540
0,150 150,360 360,480 660,2010 2100,2310
To make the chord I

111
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,550
0,210 210,330 330,1050 1200,1620 1620,2010
want to shift not reset

112
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,230
0,150 150,840 900,1080 1080,1230 1230,1680
my fingers when I'm moving

113
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,850
0,300 300,570 570,630 630,930 930,1590
these cords in between positions.|

114
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,530
0,240 240,330 330,480 480,630 630,690
If I go from A

115
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,640
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,870 900,1110
G to an A I

116
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,960
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,930 930,1320
just lift the pressure off

117
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,040
0,150 150,360 360,450 450,570 570,720
and bring it up to

118
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,180
0,90 90,450 480,690 690,780 780,1140
an a put the pressure

119
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,950
0,240 240,510 510,1380 1470,1650 1650,1770
back down again you want

120
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,910
0,60 60,270 270,360 360,870 870,960
to try and avoid as

121
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,960
0,120 120,390 390,630 630,960 960,1050
we're getting now, more and

122
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,940
0,240 240,870 1110,1650 1650,1800 1800,1980
more chords not to have

123
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,830
0,180 180,870 900,1110 1110,1440 1650,1890
to reset and read take

124
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,790
0,120 120,360 360,690 690,900 900,960
your hand off, find the

125
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,170
0,360 360,570 570,960 960,1020 1020,1380
place then reform the cord

126
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,100
0,330 330,540 540,600 600,720 720,780
just move to where you

127
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,330
0,150 150,240 240,600 900,1140 1140,1230
need to go keep the

128
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,430
0,330 330,1020 1050,1200 1200,1560 1560,2100
hands basically your fingers basically.|

129
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,770
0,150 150,210 210,510 510,1110 1170,1290
In the same position and

130
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,550
0,90 90,210 210,420 420,480 480,780
then you're ready to hit

131
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,370
0,480 570,1140 1200,1680 1680,1950 1950,2430
okay now let's talk about,

132
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,660
0,600
um.|

133
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,810
0,510 540,1110 1110,1260 1260,1350 1350,1680
The notes on the fifth

134
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,040
0,480 660,870 870,1020 1020,1080 1080,1230
string, that's where it all

135
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,910
0,270 270,510 510,630 630,750 750,870
starts, remember how we did

136
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,720
0,90 90,330 330,420 420,480 480,810
the notes on the sixth

137
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,620
0,330 420,630 630,720 720,840 840,900
string, now we're going to

138
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,340
0,150 150,210 210,510 510,630 630,720
learn the notes on the

139
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,500
0,420 420,810
fifth string.|

140
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,470
0,390 450,750 750,840 840,1020 1290,1830
Okay, this is the string,

141
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,660
0,420 420,660 660,870 870,1350 1380,1710
same rules still apply half

142
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,860
0,240 240,600 600,810 810,900 900,1200
step between what two pairs

143
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,960
0,90 90,540 1170,1500 1500,1620 1620,2100
of notes e and f

144
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,780
0,300 300,540 540,690 690,1170
and b and c.|

145
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,850
0,180 180,390 390,660 660,750 750,900
So let's count it up

146
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,170
0,90 90,240 420,810 810,930 930,1320
on the string you ready.|

147
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,460
0,2340
A.|

148
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,260
0,1260
B.|

149
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,830
0,840 840,1020 1020,1200 1200,1440 1440,1650
See you should already know

150
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,420
0,570 900,1290 1290,1380 1380,1530 1530,1590
those now we need a

151
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,530
0,330 330,630 630,840 840,960 960,1110
whole step up to A

152
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,540
0,600 960,1680 1680,1800 1800,1950 1950,2010
D now we want to

153
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,590
0,120 120,240 240,300 300,780 780,1050
go to a knee that's

154
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,900
0,60 60,420 420,1050
a whole step.|

155
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,580
0,900 900,1050 1050,1230 1230,1290 1290,1410
Now we want to go

156
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,140
0,150 150,690 720,930 930,1260 1260,1560
to f that's whatever half

157
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,380
0,600
steps.|

158
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,860
0,390 390,450 450,570 570,660 660,1320
Need to go to g

159
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,640
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,510 510,780
that would be a whole

160
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,540
0,690 690,2130 2580,3540
step and a.|

161
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,650
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,420 420,840
Up here at the twelfth

162
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,300
0,390 390,1410 1410,1500 1500,1620 1620,1650
fret zat would be a

163
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,740
0,240 240,690 720,960 960,1020 1020,1440
whole step remember the magical

164
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,510
0,390 390,840 1080,1410 1410,1530 1530,1770
twelve threat, that's where everything

165
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,590
0,330 330,660 660,780 780,960 960,1080
starts repeating so that's where

166
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,700
0,120 120,240 240,690 690,810 810,1110
we would expect an a

167
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,580
0,120 120,510
to b.|

168
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,300

0,150 150,390 390,510 510,630 630,840
Now, just like we had

186
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,260
0,630 840,1560 1830,2280 2790,3150 3150,3420
five forms of the six

187
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,280
0,210 210,510 510,840 840,900 900,1020
string barre forms we're going

188
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,780
0,60 60,210 210,630 630,1200 1320,1500
to have five forms of

189
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,430
0,210 210,600 990,1140 1140,1290 1290,1650
our other of our fifth

0,330 330,600 600,990 990,1230 1410,1650
string bar forms now lets

191
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,370
0,210 210,300 300,540 540,810 810,1290
review the six string, first

192
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,200

We learned our f minor.|

194
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,510
0,180 180,420 420,600 600,750 750,1440
We learned our f seven.|

195
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,570
0,150 150,420 420,630 630,810 810,1200
We learned our f minor

196
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,160
0,600 1110,1230 1230,1350 1350,1560 1560,1590
seventh and we learned a

197
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,980
0,300 300,1020
ref suspended.|

198
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,940
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,810 810,1170
OK, one more thing before

0,270
we.|

200
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,180
0,720 720,900 900,1140 1140,1380 1380,1620
Dive into these fifth string

201
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,470
0,270 270,630 720,1050 1050,1230 1230,1290
bar forms, let's give you

202
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,610
0,90 90,240 240,390 390,570 570,1140
a little bit more practice

203
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,170
0,210 210,690 690,1140 1140,1350 1350,1560

0,90 90,330 330,780 780,870 870,1050
our first position, we should

222
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,670
0,120 120,450 450,780 780,870 870,1140

0,960 990,1620 1620,1770 1770,1830 1830,1920
Flat right there at the

228
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,500
0,360 360,690 1800,1980 1980,2070 2070,2130
sixth fret, let's do a

229
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,330
0,210 210,570 570,750 750,1380 1590,1830
couple more a flat where

230
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,250
0,120 150,420 420,870 870,1170 1440,1920
would a flat b well

231
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,750
0,420 420,720 720,780 780,1080 1110,1440

0,510 510,720 840,1020 1020,1140 1140,1350
that way, so the answer

234
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,900
0,60 60,270 270,450 450,570 570,660
is not that way, the

0,90 90,270 270,450 450,570 570,690
we would be at the

268
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,030
0,540 690,2520 2520,3270 3270,3510 3510,4320

0,360 690,1470 1500,1740 1740,2160 2160,2280
string jumping from string to

276
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,570
0,600 780,900 900,1020 1020,1080 1080,1200
string is going to be

277
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,740
0,60 60,510 510,960 960,1080 1080,1170
an important concept when we

278
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,390
0,300 300,660 660,900 900,1200 1200,1650

279
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,590
0,420 420,540 540,660 660,840 840,930
now let's talk about the

280
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,150
0,390 390,750 750,1050 1110,1290 1290,1560
five forms that are based

281
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,740
0,120 120,240 240,510 510,840 1140,1590
off the fifth string OK

282
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,850
0,240 240,330 330,570 570,840 840,1080

0,480
chords.|

284
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,160
0,570 600,690 690,960 960,1080 1080,1140

want to take a look

286

K B minor, okay.|

288
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,720
0,420 480,810 810,1620 1770,2370 2700,2850
That we bar again, we

289
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,190
0,270 270,750 750,1170 1170,1350 1350,1470
bar five strings with our

290
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,690
0,510 630,1110 1140,1290 1290,1380 1380,1500
first finger, if you want

291
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,680
0,60 60,540 540,600 600,810 810,990
to overshoot a little bit

292
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,090
0,240 240,660 720,1020 1020,1170 1170,1410
that's fine, you can bump

293
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,530
0,180 180,510 720,1110 1110,1320 1320,1440
into that six string as

294
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,370
0,180 180,240 240,330 330,540 540,840
long as you don't play

295
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,330
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,720 720,960
it when you're playing down

296
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,260
0,120 120,240 240,450 450,600 600,930
here, we just get five

297
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,180
0,600 870,1230 1260,1410 1410,1620 1620,1920
strings okay so he's borrowing

all of those.|

299
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,070
0,510 510,660 660,780 780,900 900,1260
Now I need my third

300
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,810
0,540 570,720 720,900 900,1320 1320,1740

0,1590
pinky.|

302
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,000
0,480 480,780 780,930 930,1080 1080,1500

0,210 210,510 870,1260 1440,1800 1800,2100
On that now just just

305
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,090
0,300 300,720 750,990 990,1170 1170,1530
make sure that you're basing

306
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,080
0,180 180,360 360,450 450,540 540,990
these off of the second

307
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,310
0,210 210,390 390,660 660,1050 1050,1230
threat because remember b is

308
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,780
0,150 150,300 300,750 750,1080 1290,1470
on that second fret so

309
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,680
0,240 240,450 450,540 540,690 690,900
where f we were down

310
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,490
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,630 630,810
here at this first fret

311
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,450
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,630 630,960
we've pretty much done everything

312
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,290
0,210 210,270 270,330 330,600 600,840
down to the first fret

313
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,700
0,270 270,570 570,660 660,990 990,1170
for these we shift up

314
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,660
0,60 60,240 240,480 720,840 840,960
a little bit and the

315
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,010
0,540 570,720 720,1080 1080,1260 1260,1350
b we're pivoting off of

316
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,060
0,210 210,510 510,660 660,750 750,1050
this b so our first

317
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,900
0,180 180,270 270,600 600,690 690,840
finger is actually on that

318
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,420
0,480 480,780 780,1320
second fret position.|

319
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,210
0,510 1290,1500 1500,1770 1770,1950 1950,2610
Okay so there's b minor,

320
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,910
0,150 150,450 450,690 690,1410 1980,2400
what about b seventh well

321
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,890
0,210 210,270 270,600 600,930 930,1380
take my second finger off

322
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,600
0,150 150,180 180,420 420,750 780,1260
and I put my pinky

323
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,510
0,600 990,1260 1260,1620 1920,2430 2430,2910
down on that second string.|

324
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,170
0,330 330,660 900,1020 1020,1200 1200,1290
Hey, maybe do one more

325
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,460
0,1230
time.|

326
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,130
0,180 180,390 390,510 510,690 690,930
Make sure all these notes

327
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,120
0,60 60,480 480,630 630,900 900,990
are sounding out nice and

328
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,980
0,450
clear.|

329
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
0,240 240,540 540,720 720,1170 1170,1680
What's left b minor seventh,

330
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,750
0,240 240,360 360,510 510,600 600,990
well I put my second

331
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,620
0,270 270,540 540,630 630,780 780,870
finger down and take my

332
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,060
0,360 360,570 570,1020
pinky off again.|

333
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,420
0,360 360,480 480,810 810,1080 1080,1380
Got my bar down nice

334
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,540
0,90 90,900
and strong.|

335
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,380
0,180 180,300 300,630 630,810 810,1200
If it sounds little buzzy

336
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,310
0,90 90,150 150,420 420,480 480,930
on a couple of notes

337
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,260
0,330 330,450 450,630 630,900 900,1410
try and get good position

338
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,320
0,240 240,420
on it.|

339
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,680
0,480 480,600 600,810 810,1110 1110,1380
Strengthen up that first finger

340
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,210
0,60 60,270 270,600 1080,1380 1380,1530
a little bit got b

341
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,730
0,270 270,990 990,1260 1260,1500 1500,2520
minor seventh now be suspended

342
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,660
0,150 150,240 240,480 480,630 630,690
is the next one I

343
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,780
0,150 150,210 210,690
want to cover.|

344
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,500
0,480 480,690 690,810 810,1140 1140,1350
That has my pinky down

345
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,610
0,180 180,300 300,360 360,540 540,1110
like on the b seventh

346
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,990
0,300 300,360 360,780 780,900 900,1380
but I shift my pinky

347
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,340
0,270 270,420 420,780 780,840 840,1350
out a half a step.|

348
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,620
0,750
HMM.|

349
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,590
0,480 480,630 630,690 690,810 810,870
Wow, so I got a

350
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,700
0,180 180,360 360,780 780,900 900,1110
pretty good stretch on that

351
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,410
0,330 330,540 540,630 630,870 870,1710
one that's A B suspended.|

352
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,900
0,480 480,630 630,750 750,990 990,1230
Okay, and I'm just hitting

353
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,720
0,120 120,420 420,1230 1230,1590 2250,2820
the five strings, don't accidentally

354
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,790
0,150 150,330 330,690 690,1110 1380,2070
hit that six string accuracy

355
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,430
0,420 420,510 510,900 900,1260 1680,2640
counts and guitar playing you're

356
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,930
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,930 930,1500
just going for five strings

357
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,740
0,210 210,360 360,450 450,600 600,810
make sure you get all

358
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,620
0,810
five.|

359
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,120
0,120 120,270 270,570 570,750 750,1140
You gotta stretch that pinky

360
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,870
0,90 90,120 120,300 300,570 570,750
out a little bit get

361
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,150
0,330 540,1080 1080,1380 1800,2130 2130,2280
him loosened up remember we

362
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,500
0,180 180,300 300,390 390,720 720,1350
always do our finger exercise

363
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,910
0,420 420,690 690,1050 1050,1200 1200,1410
strengthen that limber up that

364
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,650
0,540 540,780 960,1290 1290,1410 1410,1740
handle bit if your pinky

365
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,430
0,210 210,330 330,390 390,570 570,780
doesn't want to do that

366
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,200
0,600 780,1200 1200,1470 1470,1680 1680,1770
initially remember limber nus in

367
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,310
0,120 120,360 360,630 630,900 900,1110
your hand takes time, just

368
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,500
0,150 150,690 690,990 990,1350 1590,2190
like stretching takes time, um,

369
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,430
0,90 90,180 180,330 330,510 600,930
if you want to start

370
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,590
0,600 870,1200 1200,1470 1470,1680 1680,2160
stretching, um with big muscles,

371
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,880
0,420 420,540 540,690 690,870 870,1260
same way with little muscles

372
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,870
0,300 300,420 420,540 540,630 630,990
even though you may not

373
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,650
0,90 90,270 270,330 330,510 510,780
be able to get that

374
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,210
0,390 390,810 990,1140 1140,1380 1380,1500
right now that doesn't mean

375
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,990
0,180 180,390 390,510 510,600 600,780
you're ever going to get

376
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,890
0,300 300,480 480,660 660,780 780,900
it just means you need

377
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,000
0,90 90,360 360,480 480,660 660,1110
to limber up that handle

378
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,360
0,240
bit.|

379
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,860
0,720
MHM.|

380
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,780
0,360 360,1110 1140,1380 1380,1500 1500,1920
Be suspended, now the last

381
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,680
0,150 150,210 210,390 390,450 450,900
one I want to cover

382
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,360
0,330 330,930
is b.|

383
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,560
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,690 690,930
Now you may think that

384
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,430
0,150 150,240 240,330 330,420 420,870
should have been the first

385
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,420
0,420 450,570 570,630 630,900 900,990
well there's a couple of

386
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,700
0,420 420,600 600,930
problems would be.|

387
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,190
0,210 210,360 360,660 660,930 930,1050
There's two different ways you

388
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,390
0,120 120,540 540,810 810,930 930,1200
can finger if you'll notice

389
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,650
0,120 120,450 450,750 750,1020 1020,1260
the first finger down there

390
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,700
0,120 120,420 420,540 540,930 930,1050
I've got a bar all

391
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,360
0,60 60,180 180,420 420,540 540,660
the way here and then

392
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,320
0,120 120,300 300,630 630,840 840,960
I've got second third and

393
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,240
0,300 300,720 720,1320 1320,1470 1470,1920
fourth all squished in here.|

394
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,400
0,450 450,810 900,1500 1500,2010 2190,2340
On that fourth fret and

395
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,990
0,150 150,330 330,840 840,1170 1170,1590
they're all squished right underneath

396
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,840
0,180 180,570
each other.|

397
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,450
0,240 240,390 390,900 900,1320 1320,1410
Which is pretty tricky to

398
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,340
0,510
get.|

399
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,580
0,840 840,990 990,1110 1110,1350 1350,1770
Hmm, when you're just starting

400
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,420
0,360
out.|

401
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,340
0,240 240,750 1170,1470 1470,1710 1740,2190
So that's that's the accurate

402
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,180
0,120 120,210 210,510 510,750 750,840
way to play that now

403
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,840
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,510 510,660
that may be a little

404
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,790
0,390 390,660 660,810 1260,1530 1530,1950
tricky for you an easier

405
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,460
0,420 840,1500 1500,1890 1890,2250 2250,2670
way not quite as as.|

406
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,110
0,480 480,600 600,690 690,930 930,1020
Accurate way to play it

407
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,920
0,120 120,210 210,570 570,720 720,810
but an easier way and

408
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,640
0,30 30,180 180,240 240,510 510,720
a lot of guys use

409
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,780
0,150 150,330 330,450 450,900 900,1140
it so it's nothing wrong

410
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,160
0,120 120,300 570,990 990,1110 1110,1380
with it is they take

411
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,200
0,210 210,720 1620,1800 1800,1920 1920,2040
this b and then they

412
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,490
0,240 240,780 780,960 960,1230 1230,1290
just bar, all three of

413
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,340
0,480 900,1080 1080,1230 1230,1500 1500,2850
these with your third finger.|

414
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,620
0,300 300,660
See that.|

415
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,300
0,180 180,420 420,480 480,750 750,1290
So instead of doing this.|

416
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,500
0,180 180,420 420,1170 1230,2190 2190,2550
They just bar that now

417
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,390
0,240 240,750 750,1200 1500,1680 1680,1890
the problem is is that

418
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,650
0,120 120,420 420,630 630,870 870,1260
you can't play that last

419
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,740
0,540 1950,2190 2190,2400 2400,2640 2640,3090
string you end up with

420
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,000
0,180 180,450 450,840 840,1200
a dead string there.|

421
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,420
0,630 720,1080 1080,1200 1200,1320 1320,2010
So, or if you're sloppy

422
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,470
0,180 180,390 390,450 450,660 660,930
you bar the whole thing

423
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,670
0,780 780,870 870,990 990,1080 1080,1200
and you end up with

424
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,440
0,60 60,420 420,1140 1260,1470 1470,1770
the wrong chord so either

425
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,030
0,240 240,540 540,750 750,840 840,1590
gotta get off a vacuum

426
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,430
0,990 990,1350 1350,1860 1860,2220 2220,2400
string or don't play that

427
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,310
0,330 330,690 690,2070 2100,2580 2610,2880
last string OK so this

428
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,090
0,240 240,300 300,420 420,600 600,780
way you can play all

429
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,500
0,330 330,450 450,990 990,1200 1200,1410
five of them with this

430
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,790
0,540 540,840 840,1050 1050,1140 1140,1290
form, you just do the

431
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,220
0,540 540,1050
inside four.|

432
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,250
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,930 1320,1710
See how that works okay,

433
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,720
0,390 390,510 510,960 960,1080 1080,1440
those are basically the five

434
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,530
0,360 360,480 480,600 600,750 750,810
forms, let's go through a

435
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,210
0,270 270,330 330,420 420,1260 1380,1680
couple of the exercises that

436
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,800
0,150 150,390 390,630 630,900 1230,1590
you have in your book.|

437
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,060
0,270 270,450 450,570 570,660 660,780
Okay, let's look at some

438
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,560
0,60 60,240 240,510 510,750 750,1500
of those barre chord exercises

439
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,720
0,210 210,300 300,1200 1230,1830 1830,2160
on the fifth string using

440
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,160
0,120 120,330 330,630 630,960 960,1440
our fifth string bar forms,

441
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,500
0,300 360,750 750,1140 1500,1980 1980,2340
okay number one starts out

442
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,000
0,180 180,420 420,660 660,1260
with that b minor.|

443
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,990
0,450 570,750 750,840 840,1170 1320,1710
Okay, here, we go for

444
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,000
0,300 780,1200 1200,1470 1470,1560 1560,2010
Mid finger, nice and straight

445
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,000
0,390 390,900 900,1080 1080,1650
wrist low and forward.|

446
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,690
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,690 690,1350
Here we go, b minor

447
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,030
0,690 1020,1590 1800,3180 3210,4170 4200,5040
ready go go two three

448
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,170
0,330 330,540 540,630 630,780 780,840
four now you need to

449
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,490
0,450 450,600 600,810 810,1020 1020,1320
slide up just one half

450
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,510
0,300 300,480 480,570 570,780 780,1020
step up to see man,

451
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,890
0,240 240,360 360,600 600,870 870,1380
remember we talked about sliding

452
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,730
0,570 750,2370 2370,2580 2580,2940 3090,3690
don't reposition every note just.|

453
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,510
0,270 270,360 360,480 480,990 990,1350
Let up the pressure scoot

454
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,260
0,120 120,240 240,480 480,510 510,750
up your hand a half

455
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,900
0,570
step.|

456
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,940
0,420 420,570 570,630 630,930 930,1500
Now you're A C minor,

457
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,230
0,300 300,390 390,540 540,870 870,1020
now we're gonna scoot up

458
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,680
0,90 90,420 420,1140
to d minor.|

459
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,080
0,810
MHM.|

460
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,740
0,630
Two.|

461
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,040
0,720 900,1140 1140,1350 1350,1860 1890,2100
Three one more scoop up

462
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
0,120 120,330 330,1770
to e minor.|

463
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,230
0,300 300,540 540,720 720,960 960,1050
Let's jump back down to

464
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,400
0,180 180,840
be minor.|

465
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,480
0,810
NO.|

466
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
0,540 540,750 750,870 870,1050 1050,1440
Good, see how that works,

467
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,390
0,210 210,330 330,930 1080,1290 1290,1770
if you try to reset

468
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,460
0,120 120,720 750,1050 1050,1650 1860,2070
your cord every time you'll

469
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,750
0,540 540,690 690,870 870,1200 1200,1290
find that that slows you

470
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,680
0,180 180,690
way down.|

471
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,320
0,300 300,720 720,1170 1170,1350 1350,1380
Just get practice that a

472
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,900
0,180 180,660 660,1020 1020,2100 2100,2580
little bit playing record releasing

473
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,500
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,540 540,600
it, you don't need to

474
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,490
0,180 180,300 300,660 660,840 840,990
bring your fingers off the

475
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,020
0,390 390,630 630,900 900,990 990,1530
strings just release the pressure

476
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,880
0,420 420,540 540,840 840,1380 1380,1470
shift your hand up to

477
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,780
0,150 150,210 210,450 450,540 540,900
where it needs to be

478
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,340
0,210 210,300 300,630 630,870 870,1500
put the pressure back down.|

479
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,860
0,300 300,360 360,600 600,1410 1440,2220
It's a lot more efficient

480
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
0,240 240,450 450,930 930,1050 1050,1320
in your cording with that

481
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,500
0,210 210,300 300,360 360,540 540,840
let's look at number two.|

482
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,670
0,330 330,390 390,540 540,690 690,1020
Starts on that b minor

483
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,400
0,420
again.|

484
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,660
0,690
Ready.|

485
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,620
0,480
Play.|

486
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,520
0,630
MOU.|

487
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,410
0,750 750,1260 1260,2040 2070,2220 2220,2310
Now, c major so I

488
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,980
0,330 330,480 480,570 570,1230
shift up to c.|

489
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,960
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,480 480,900
And if I can squeeze

490
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,160
0,150 150,300 300,690 690,840 840,1200
all my fingers in there

491
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,580
0,840 870,1170 1170,1440 1440,3270
I get c major.|

492
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,550
0,150 150,210 210,360 360,600 600,810
Then I go back down

493
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,780
0,60 60,240 240,1170
to be minor.|

494
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,810
0,570 570,810 810,1110 1110,1260 1260,1380
I'm now shift up to

495
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,250
0,600 840,960 960,1080 1080,1260 1260,1440
d I'm gonna use that

496
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,410
0,240 240,1830 1830,1950 1950,2010 2010,2160
other form, but I have

497
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,240
0,90 90,630 1260,1500 1500,1650 1650,1830
to remember don't hit that

498
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,790
0,300 300,930 1110,1380 1380,2430 2430,2550
last string okay, let's do

499
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,050
0,120 120,210 210,570 570,720 720,1260
that one again b minor.|

500
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,600
0,990
See.|

501
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,200
0,2010 2010,2670
B minor.|

502
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,440
0,480
HMM.|

503
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
0,1380
HMM.|

504
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,700
0,990
HMM.|

505
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,680
0,750 840,1230 1260,1680 1680,2040 2040,2100
Good, now let's shift it

506
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,310
0,150 150,180 180,330 330,480 480,630
up a little bit let's

507
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,570
0,210 210,360 360,420 420,690 690,1260
skip over to number five.|

508
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,410
0,480 870,1170 1170,1530 1740,2010 2010,2310
Okay, let's see number five

509
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,820
0,270 270,360 360,510 540,1020 1020,1410
starts on that effect at.|

510
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,460
0,270 270,690
Right here.|

511
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,480
0,660 1020,1590 1800,3000 3030,4020 4020,4650
Ready go, go to three

512
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,610
0,450 450,960 960,1680 1710,1920 1920,2100
c minor seventh jump down

513
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,620
0,60 60,690

0,210 210,300 300,510 510,990
way at the end.|

522
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,780
0,270 270,420 420,810 810,1170
Bring that pinky up.|

Woo.|

527
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,140
0,480
Alright.|

528
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,720
0,480 480,780 780,1050 1050,1110 1110,1230
Now this time in our

529
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,800
0,180 180,480 480,720 720,1020 1020,1080
how music works section, we're

530
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,940
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,570 570,1140
going to talk about major

531
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,180
0,930
scales.|

532
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,460
0,510 630,1320 1320,1380 1380,1680 1680,1980
Okay remember the major scale

533
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,420
0,270 270,360 360,420 420,690 690,960
pattern that we talked about

534
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,730
0,420 420,660 660,1170 1410,1920 1920,2310
whole whole half whole whole

535
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,140
0,330 330,780 810,1020 1020,1350 1350,1410
whole half to holes in

536
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,550
0,60 60,480 690,960 960,1320 1320,1410
the half three holes and

537
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,080
0,90 90,450 690,1050 1050,1230 1230,1530
a half now you'll notice

538
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,830
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,660 660,750
as you did all of

539
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,820
0,270 270,360 360,690 690,810 810,990
those and hopefully you did

540
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,450
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,510 510,630
them and did them and

541
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,200
0,150 150,450
did them.|

542
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,010
0,510 840,1050 1050,1140 1140,1320 1320,1560
Um, as you did, although

543
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,640
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,600 600,630
you came up with a

544
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,710
0,450 450,1320 1320,1530 1530,1950 1950,2070
certain combination of sharps and

545
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,420
0,450 450,630 630,840 840,1320 1320,1710
flats for each particular key

546
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,530
0,540 540,660 660,720 720,840 840,900
that's what we're going to

547
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,720
0,210 210,480 480,840 1140,1500 1800,2190
talk about now that's key

548
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,840
0,870
signatures.|

549
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,890
0,600 630,780 780,990 990,1380 1410,1950
Now, when we talked earlier

550
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,580
0,120 120,270 270,330 330,390 390,690
in some of the earlier

551
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,530
0,510 510,660 660,870 870,1410 1560,1950
sessions I just mentioned that

552
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,310
0,120 120,180 180,570 570,690 690,780
at the beginning of a

553
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,510
0,270 270,360 360,720 720,1080 1080,1200
piece of music, sometimes you'll

554
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,100
0,210 210,300 300,930 1050,1350 1350,1590
see a sharp just right

555
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,870
0,240 240,330 330,660 660,1140 1410,1770
after the clef sign something

556
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,460
0,210 210,510 810,1230 1230,1350 1350,1590
like that, that's what that

557
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,630
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,690 690,1170
is, that's a key signature

558
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,200
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,390 390,570
now we're going to tell

559
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,610
0,120 120,480 480,690 690,900 900,1410
you why that key signature

560
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,570
0,120 120,420 450,630 630,780 780,960
is there how that key

561
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,160
0,450 450,540 540,1110 1200,1440 1440,1590
signature is developed, it's not

562
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,240
0,150 180,720 720,930 930,1020 1020,1080
just random that in a

563
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,860
0,510 510,930 1020,1320 1320,1440 1440,1620
particular song let's say there's

564
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,030
0,150 150,450 450,930 960,1110 1110,1170
an f sharp in the

565
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,320
0,240 240,660 660,810 810,1080 1080,1290
key signature that all f's

566
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,980
0,90 90,570
are sharp.|

567
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,300
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,840 840,930
We're going to determine that

568
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,200
0,270 270,390 390,750 750,840 840,900
that is actually in the

569
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,620
0,300 300,420 420,1080
key of g.|

570
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,740
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,510 510,810
And the key of g

571
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,330
0,480 540,870 870,1290 1290,1440 1440,1590
has one sharp in it

572
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,320
0,180 180,300 300,780 780,870 870,990
from our scales that we

573
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,580
0,210 210,570 570,930
learned last time.|

574
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,720
0,180 180,360 360,690 690,990 990,1830
And that sharp is always

575
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,100
0,270 270,840
f sharp.|

576
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,810
0,720 720,1020 1020,1530 1530,1830 1830,1890
Sharps and flats come in

577
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,910
0,60 60,750 780,1440 1740,1980 1980,2100
a specific order as you're

578
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,620
0,330 330,450 450,630 630,900 900,1710
writing them in key signatures.|

579
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,400
0,240 240,600 600,1200
The first sharp.|

580
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,560
0,150 150,360 360,660 660,750 750,900
No matter whether I have

581
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,600
0,480 480,690 690,1260 1410,1650 1650,2040
one or seven is always

582
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,310
0,120 120,210 210,570 840,1110 1110,1710
going to be f sharp.|

583
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,770
0,180 180,330 330,510 510,570 570,660
It could think of it

584
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,000
0,180 180,240 240,900
like a pyramid.|

585
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,440
0,150 150,390 390,510 510,780 780,1350
The key with one sharp.|

586
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,260
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,630 630,1140
It would be f sharp,

587
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,130
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,540 540,690
then if you had two

588
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,270
0,360 360,480 480,630 630,900 900,1140
sharps it would be f

589
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,520
0,270 270,360 360,570 570,1020
sharp and c sharp.|

590
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,750
0,150 150,210 210,330 330,480 480,690
And if you have three

591
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,860
0,450 450,570 570,690 690,900 900,1110
sharps, it would be f

592
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,970
0,300 300,510 510,810 810,930 930,1110
sharp c sharp and g

593
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,260
0,390 420,630 630,990 990,1110 1110,1290
sharp, they build on each

594
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,550
0,240 240,480 480,780 960,1230 1230,1290
other like that, so I

595
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,600
0,480 480,630 630,750 750,960 960,1050
wouldn't put them out of

596
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,950
0,420 510,660 660,750 750,1020 1020,1350
order, if we start thinking

597
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,000
0,90 90,240 240,480 480,600 600,1050
of them out of order

598
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,350
0,480 480,600 600,780 780,930 930,1170
a it won't make sense

599
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,070
0,150 150,240 240,450 450,510 510,720
when you're looking at key

600
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,450
0,600 840,1050 1050,1260 1260,1320 1320,1380
signatures, they come in a

601
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,370
0,210 210,720 720,1140 1260,1500 1500,1920
very specific order f sharpest,

602
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,050
0,450 630,810 810,1020 1020,1200 1200,1680
first f sharp c sharp

603
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,250
0,210 210,420 420,630 630,900 900,1050
f sharp c sharp g

604
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,510
0,450 630,750 750,930 930,1110 1110,1260
sharp and so on, from

605
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,700
0,120
there.|

606
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,240
0,210 210,390 390,660 660,780 780,1020
Okay so order is very

607
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,080
0,510
important.|

608
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,900
0,630
Now.|

609
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,980
0,300 300,540 540,750 750,1200 1200,1890
We talked about major scales,

610
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,210
0,420 420,570 570,690 690,750 750,1140
now I'm going to adjust

611
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:15,870
0,90 90,120 120,330 330,540 540,660
it a little bit and

612
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,860
0,90 90,210 210,270 270,540 540,990
we're going to talk about

613
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,340
0,840 840,1680 2100,2550 2820,3120 3120,3330
minor scales, now there's all

614
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,900
0,330 330,390 390,660 660,960 960,1560
kinds of different minor scales.|

615
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,630
0,180 180,450 450,840 840,960 960,1050
I play guitar for a

616
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,400
0,450
living.|

617
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,520
0,180 180,390 390,630 630,810 810,900
I don't use all of

618
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,660
0,180 180,600 600,720 720,930 930,1140
those scales, the only other

619
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,100
0,360 360,780 780,1020 1020,1200 1200,1440
minor scale other than a

620
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,440
0,540 540,1140 1170,1560 1800,2010 2010,2310
natural minor I have ever

621
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,940
0,360 360,510 510,570 570,1080 1080,1500
used is a harmonic minor,

622
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,650
0,270 270,540 540,720 720,930 930,1320
some guys get all busy

623
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,640
0,120 120,330 330,450 450,510 510,990
and bent out of shape

624
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,960
0,420 420,510 510,690 690,960 960,1290
learning all these different minor

625
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,920
0,450 540,690 690,780 780,900 900,960
forms, you don't need to

626
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,680
0,210 210,510
know that.|

627
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,080
0,390 390,660 660,900 900,990 990,1320
How I think of minor

628
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,160
0,390 390,540 540,690 690,750 750,1080
scales, it's not a whole

629
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,600
0,180 180,600 660,840 840,1140 1140,1440
new world you relate everything

630
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,860
0,240 240,330 330,390 390,720 720,1260
back to a major scale

631
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,540
0,180 180,570 570,930 930,1080 1080,1260
a major scale, let's take

632
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,980
0,60 60,360 360,720 720,1200
A C major scale.|

633
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,520
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,1200
It goes from c.|

634
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,390
0,390 390,600 600,840 840,1110 1110,1290
D E F G A

635
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,340
0,210 210,750 810,1260 1260,1410 1410,1950
B C C to c.|

636
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,910
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,930 930,1380
To get a minor scale

637
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,160
0,300 300,630 780,1110 1110,1410 1410,2250
from that I go down

638
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,240
0,450 450,630 630,720 720,810 810,960
actually think of it like

639
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,470
0,90 90,420 420,720 1020,1140 1140,1230
a number line, you know

640
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,250
0,90 90,390 390,480 480,690 690,780
it starts at c and

641
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,030
0,120 120,180 180,450 450,690 690,780
then it just goes to

642
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,020
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,630 630,990
see and it keeps going.|

643
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,320
0,330 330,390 390,540 540,660 660,840
If I want to get

644
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,580
0,30 30,390 390,870 930,1020 1020,1260
a minor scale I just

645
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,780
0,210 210,420 420,720 720,1080 1080,1200
take that major scale and

646
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,280
0,90 90,630 630,1170
I shifted down.|

647
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,880
0,150 150,480 480,570 570,1170
A couple of steps.|

648
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,660
0,300 300,870
Two steps.|

649
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,390
0,240 240,810 840,1050 1050,1260 1260,1410
So now I'm doing I'm

650
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,960
0,180 180,240 240,300 300,480 480,570
still in the key of

651
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,070
0,330 330,510 510,900 900,960 960,1110
c no sharps or no

652
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,900
0,570 750,990 990,1080 1080,1590 1590,1830
flats but I'm starting on

653
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,100
0,210 240,930
an a.|

654
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,250
0,180 180,300 300,780 1110,1410 1410,1650
So I'm going now from

655
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,870
0,330 330,570 570,1110 1170,1440 1440,1590
a to a not from

656
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,460
0,330 330,450 450,990 1380,1530 1530,1590
c to c but I'm

657
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,210
0,240 240,300 300,360 360,660 660,750
still in the key of

658
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,320
0,240 240,420 420,750 750,810 810,1110
c, no sharps or flats,

659
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,010
0,90 90,150 150,360 360,480 480,690
so I end up with

660
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,620
0,600 870,1170 1170,1680 1980,2280 2280,2520
A B C D E

661
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,960
0,240 240,570 570,1170
F G A.|

662
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,690
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,840 840,1170
That is a minor scale,

663
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,290
0,150 150,240 240,450 450,510 510,600
what we call in the

664
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,060
0,330 330,480 480,960 960,1290 1290,1770
business a natural minor scale

665
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,190
0,540 600,1050 1050,1140 1140,1530 1530,1830
okay, those are built off

666
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,960
0,150 150,240 240,690 690,1320 1440,1770
of the major scales, there's

667
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,000
0,60 60,540 540,1200 1200,1680 1680,2040
a special relationship between that

668
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,980
0,570 870,1080 1080,1140 1140,1560 1560,1950
minor and the major scale,

669
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,960
0,120 120,540 540,1410 1530,1770 1770,1980
it's called parallel, we hear

670
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,820
0,240 240,690
that term.|

671
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,280
0,360 390,780 780,1020 1020,1050 1050,1260
A floated around a lot,

672
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,060
0,90 90,300 300,360 360,540 540,780
we'll talk a lot about

673
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,980
0,240 540,1380 1380,1740 1740,1860 1860,1920
that things something is a

674
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,810
0,570 570,990 990,1140 1140,1230 1230,1830
parallel major or a parallel

675
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,790
0,480 600,900 900,1110 1110,1560 1800,1980
minor what that means is

676
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,450
0,150 150,300 300,360 360,420 420,660
if I'm in the key

677
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,320
0,90 90,600
of c.|

678
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,690
0,180 180,300 300,480 480,540 540,750
And I want to get

679
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,100
0,60 60,150 150,660 660,1140
to the minor key.|

680
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,320
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,570 570,960
I can either go down

681
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,180
0,450 870,1110 1110,1230 1230,1530 1530,1860
too, or it's probably easier

682
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,750
0,90 90,150 150,270 270,480 480,570
for you to think of

683
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,320
0,120 120,270 270,360 360,510 510,570
it, if I go to

684
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
0,120 120,720 720,1230
the sixth step.|

685
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,850
0,210 210,360 360,750 750,1140 1140,1710
Of A C major scale.|

686
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,200
0,180 180,300 300,450 450,840 870,1260
That would be a right

687
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,820
0,390 390,690 690,930 930,1200 1200,1590
C D E F G

688
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,620
0,510
A.|

689
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,060
0,150 150,330 330,420 420,900
Now I'm in a.|

690
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,670
0,270 270,960 1230,1440 1440,1560 1560,2190
A minor is the parallel

691
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,860
0,630 900,1080 1080,1380 1380,1980
major of c major.|

692
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,460
0,210 210,480 480,1020
And vice versa.|

693
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,660
0,600 720,1230 1320,1530 1530,1650 1650,1740
Um, if if I'm in

694
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,530
0,210 210,570 570,570 570,780 780,870
c major I want the

695
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,480
0,390 390,900 960,1230 1230,1380 1380,1950
parallel minor it's a minor

696
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,160
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,690 690,1290
if I'm an a minor

697
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,360
0,180 180,210 210,360 360,450 450,840
and I want the parallel

698
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,340
0,510 750,990 990,1200 1200,1740
major its c major.|

699
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,790
0,300 330,510 510,630 630,720 720,990
Okay, let's do it, let's

700
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,080
0,270 270,360 360,630 630,810 1050,1290
figure out another one what

701
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,520
0,120 120,330 330,540 540,840 840,1440
if I'm an f major.|

702
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,540
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,540 540,1140
What would be the parallel

703
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,300
0,480 510,660 660,1110 1440,2100 2370,2760
minor of f major well

704
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,230
0,270 270,480 480,570 570,660 660,750
I just go up to

705
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,480
0,90 90,480 480,960
the sixth step.|

706
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,820
0,330 330,690 690,1080 1110,1320 1320,1650
F G A B flat

707
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,460
0,510 750,1320
c D.|

708
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,800
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,540 540,690
And that would be by

709
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,080
0,480 480,960
parallel minor.|

710
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,040
0,210 210,330 330,510 510,900 1260,1740
See how that works now

711
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,910
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,840 840,840
let's talk about keys a

712
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,580
0,180 180,390
little bit.|

713
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,670
0,420 570,810 810,1140 1140,1260 1260,1530
Okay, we touched on keys

714
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,660
0,120 120,330 330,750 750,810 810,990
and key signatures a little

715
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,430
0,150 150,660 930,1320 1320,1620 1620,1770
bit earlier, so now let's

716
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,680
0,330 330,780 780,1230 1410,1710 1710,2250
put into work, for example

717
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,360
0,240 240,330 330,600 600,750 750,1380
in the key of f.|

718
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,770
0,330 330,450 450,540 540,750 750,870
When you were doing your

719
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,440
0,600 1050,1350 1350,1800 2130,2490 2490,2670
scale you had what was

720
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,550
0,390 390,570 570,720 720,750 750,1110
different what had a sharp

721
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,020
0,60 60,390 390,600 600,750 1200,1470
or flat by it you'll

722
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,440
0,270 270,360 360,750 750,1260
notice the fourth step.|

723
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,080
0,510 510,1170
B flat.|

724
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,390
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,630 630,750
Is the only thing that

725
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,260
0,120 120,180 180,450 450,510 510,870
had a flat or sharp

726
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,800
0,120 120,210
in it.|

727
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,810
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,780 780,930
So we would say that

728
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,890
0,90 90,360 360,900 900,1020 1020,1080
the key signature for the

729
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,870
0,300 300,390 390,930 1380,1650 1650,1980
key of f has one

730
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,840
0,510 900,1260 1260,1680
flat b flat.|

731
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,620
0,180 180,300 300,540 540,750 900,1110
Let's do another one, so

732
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,550
0,60 60,150 150,360 360,720 720,930
if the key signature has

733
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,990
0,240 240,690 690,840 840,960 1260,1440
two sharps in it an

734
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,880
0,210 210,690 1020,1200 1200,1440 1440,1890
f sharp and c sharp.|

735
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,380
0,210 210,360 360,450 450,540 540,600
Then we are in the

736
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,440
0,210 210,300 300,720
key of d.|

737
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,540
0,270 270,390 390,450 450,660 660,840
Now let me tell you

738
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,160
0,180 180,720 750,1230 1230,1500 1500,1620
a very important trick that

739
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,120
0,150 150,270 270,660
you can learn.|

740
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,990
0,390 390,510 510,690 690,900 900,1290
How to tell what key

741
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,920
0,90 90,360 360,450 450,780 780,930
a piece of music is

742
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,790
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,660 660,870
in there's two different ways

743
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,930
0,60 60,630 630,690 690,870 870,1140
we're going to talk about

744
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,380
0,90
it.|

745
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,980
0,180 180,300 300,570 570,1050 1050,1440
In your first example there.|

746
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,490
0,240 240,450 450,570 570,660 660,870
You'll see that the key

747
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,720
0,390 390,600 600,690 690,900 900,1230
signature has an f sharp

748
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,320
0,120 120,270
in it.|

749
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,180
0,660 660,780 780,900 900,990 990,1170
Therefore, if you go back

750
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,620
0,90 90,150 150,900 1020,1230 1230,1440
to the scales, you'll know

751
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,460
0,120 120,270 270,480 480,690 690,840
that the only key that

752
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,050
0,420 720,960 960,1290 1290,1410 1410,1590
has one sharp in it

753
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,160
0,180 180,270 270,510 510,570 570,1020
is the key of g

754
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,120
0,180 180,240 240,330 330,690 690,750
so you can solve it

755
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,890
0,240 240,390 390,990 1050,1350 1350,1770
that way by by knowing

756
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,450
0,90 90,630 720,870 870,1140 1140,1560
your scales, the second example

757
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,380
0,210 210,390 390,630
let's do that.|

758
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,810
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,630 630,990
It has A B flat

759
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,250
0,270 270,630 630,810 810,1020 1020,1410
e flat and a flat

760
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,840
0,150 150,390 390,930 960,1320 1320,1410
well what's scale uses A

761
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,980
0,210 210,540 570,750 750,1020 1020,1140
B flat e flat and

762
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,640
0,150 150,480
a flat.|

763
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,500
0,300 300,420 420,510 510,600 600,690
Well, that would be the

764
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,740
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,900
key of e flat.|

765
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,240
0,420 480,780 780,1140 1140,1740 1740,2070
Okay, here's another trick, that's

766
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,890
0,420 870,1080 1080,1200 1200,1560 1560,1650
a little bit easier to

767
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,150
0,420 510,750 750,840 840,1050 1050,1260
learn how to tell what

768
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,380
0,360 360,390 390,630 630,690 690,990
keys a piece of music

769
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,900
0,180
in.|

770
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,790
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,780 780,1050
It has two different parts

771
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,600
0,90 90,150 300,600 600,750 750,810
of the first part of

772
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,860
0,150 150,300 300,690 690,1050 1080,1260
it in sharp keys for

773
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,840
0,420 420,930 960,1170 1170,1530 1530,1980
sharp keys, the rule is.|

774
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,520
0,180 180,270 270,510 510,570 570,1020
How to tell a key

775
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,170
0,120 120,450 450,570 570,930 930,1260
the key is one half

776
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,360
0,420 450,960 1290,1560 1560,1710 1710,2190
step up from the last

777
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,370
0,600 840,1020 1020,1080 1080,1350 1350,2010
sharp in the key signature.|

778
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,240
0,210 210,390 390,540 540,900 900,1020
I'll say that again the

779
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,950
0,390 390,780 810,960 960,1260 1260,1710
rule is for sharp keys,

780
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,660
0,120 120,600 600,750 750,1020 1020,1410
the key is one half

781
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
0,360 360,720
step up.|

782
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,160
0,240 240,330 330,720 720,1140 1140,1260
From the last sharp in

783
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,930
0,60 60,300 300,870 1290,1440 1440,1770
the key signature for example

784
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,920
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,810 810,990
if the key signature has

785
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,850
0,120 120,330 330,630 630,690 690,930
an f sharp A C

786
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,410
0,270 270,450 450,660 660,1080 1320,1560
sharp and g sharp, then

787
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,820
0,120 120,540 540,1200
the last sharp.|

788
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,260
0,180 180,240 240,450 450,720 720,900
Is A G sharp, that's

789
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,100
0,90 90,240 240,360 360,630 630,840
the one you're looking at

790
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,420
0,240 240,480 480,750 750,900 900,1050
one half step up from

791
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,310
0,90 90,270 270,780 1080,1410 1410,1890
A G sharp is a.|

792
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,740
0,300 300,420 420,990 1110,1440 1440,1890
So the key is a.|

793
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,270
0,450 720,1020 1020,1200 1200,1350 1350,1650
Okay, what about for flat

794
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,350
0,360 360,600 600,810 810,900 900,1080
keys well here's the rule

795
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,640
0,180 180,480 480,960
for flat keys.|

796
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,520
0,120 120,390 390,750 750,840 840,1260
The rule says the key

797
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,780
0,180 180,300 300,750 750,840 840,1260
is the next to last

798
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,640
0,540 750,900 900,990 990,1230 1230,1860
flat in the key signature.|

799
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,360
0,150 150,240 240,420 420,480 480,690
So you take the key

800
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,220
0,570
signature.|

801
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,360
0,510
And.|

802
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,940
0,540 540,630 630,780 780,1050
Derive it from there.|

803
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,480
0,300 300,420 420,810 810,960 960,1080
So, for example if the

804
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,650
0,240 240,690 690,870 870,960 960,1170
key signature has A B

805
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,880
0,360 390,600 600,1020 1020,1110 1110,1230
flat e flat and an

806
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,350
0,270 270,570 570,720 720,930 1260,1470
a flat in it, the

807
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,420
0,300 300,360 360,750 750,1350 1860,2070
next to last flat is

808
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,350
0,240 240,510 510,690 690,780 780,930
e flat, that's the one

809
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,240
0,90 90,360 360,600
you're looking at.|

810
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,000
0,270 270,360 360,990 1020,1260 1260,1470
So the key is e

811
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,700
0,390
flat.|

812
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,130
0,360 360,480 480,780 780,1230 1230,1320
Learning your major scales and

813
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,270
0,60 60,480 480,630 630,900 900,1140
the keys that come from

814
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,950
0,180 180,480 480,900 1170,1410 1410,1680
them takes time like learning

815
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,480
0,90 90,810 810,1170 1170,1260 1260,1530
your multiplication tables, we talked

816
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,300
0,270 270,510
about that.|

817
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,540
0,210 210,360 360,600 600,960 960,1050
You just can't solve them

818
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,440
0,180 180,390 390,480 480,810 810,900
one time and expect to

819
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,920
0,150 150,240 240,330 330,420 420,480

0,420 450,930 930,990 990,1140 1140,1200
low generally I want to

1042
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,130
0,270 270,390 390,630 630,960 960,1650
try to keep things low

1043
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,860
0,930 960,1290 1290,1410 1410,1470 1470,1830
I don't want to jump

1044
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,120
0,60 60,390 390,570 570,1230 1230,1260
to that a threat I

1045
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,170
0,180 180,240 240,480 480,750 750,1050
want to stay right that

1046
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,820
0,330 330,870 870,1350 1350,1560 1560,1650
third fret because things are

1047
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,760
0,150 150,720 720,1440 1800,2880
more comfortable down zehr.|

1048
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,800
0,780
Wow.|

1049
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,820
0,210 210,420 420,810 810,1350 1350,1770
One more g here one

1050
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,840
0,870 870,1710 1740,2340 2520,2760 2760,3510
two three four six eight

1051
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:05,150
0,840 840,1710 1800,2370 2610,4410 4410,5280
two three four two three

1052
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,600
0,600
four.|

1053
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,590
0,780 810,1560 1950,2310 2310,2640 2640,3630
Two three four last line.|

1054
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,870
0,780 990,1950 1980,2850 2880,3480 3600,3810
C one two three if

1055
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,830
0,120 120,330 330,570 570,720 720,960
we get g for two

1056
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,420
0,480 480,750 750,900 900,1110 1110,1590
beats d for two beats

1057
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,960
0,1020 1020,1110 1110,1650
back to g.|

1058
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,240
0,510 510,780
Very good.|

1059
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,190
0,270 270,330 330,390 390,630 630,780
Just for a second let's

1060
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,750
0,180 180,390 390,600 600,1350 1350,1560
talk about key signatures and

1061
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,510
0,690 1140,1590 1650,1980 1980,2130 2130,2760
keys, okay, remember how parallel

1062
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,250
0,420 420,510 510,870 870,1230 1530,1740
major and minor work in

1063
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,210
0,150 150,240 240,450 450,510 510,960
order to find a parallel

1064
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,230
0,330 330,450 450,570 570,780 780,1020
minor you go down two

1065
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,940
0,540 690,870 870,960 960,1290 1290,1710
steps from a major scale,

1066
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:35,780
0,270 270,390 390,510 510,690 690,810
or you can go up

1067
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,550
0,360 360,870 1140,1380 1380,1560 1560,1770
six steps, either way gets

1068
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,450
0,90 90,150 150,270 270,600 600,900
you to the same note.|

1069
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,620
0,270 270,360 360,630 630,1290 1320,1680
So A C major remember

1070
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,060
0,180 180,450 450,570 600,810 810,1440
what equal an a minor.|

1071
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,260
0,330 330,990
F major.|

1072
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,020
0,420 420,630 630,1230
Equals d minor.|

1073
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,120
0,510
Okay.|

1074
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,250
0,240 240,840 900,1080 1080,1380 1380,1920
Let's practice A G major

1075
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,480
0,210 210,330 330,570 570,930 1080,1200
what would that be the

1076
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,620
0,390 390,840
parallel minor.|

1077
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,020
0,270 270,840
E minor.|

1078
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,240
0,180 180,540 540,900 900,1530
What about g minor.|

1079
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,620
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,480 480,960
What would be the parallel

1080
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,680
0,360 360,840
major there.|

1081
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,900
0,360 360,750 750,1380
B flat major.|

1082
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,260
0,180 180,450 480,630 630,1020 1020,1620
What about the flat major.|

1083
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,900
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,780 780,1140
What would the parallel minor

1084
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,540
0,330
b.|

1085
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,600
0,450 450,1020
C minor.|

1086
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,140
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,540 540,750
What about if a key

1087
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,340
0,210 210,510 510,960 960,1080 1080,1200
has four sharps in it

1088
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,600
0,180 180,240 240,450 450,750 750,990
they're an f sharp c

1089
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,860
0,330 330,570 570,930 930,1050 1050,1260
sharp g sharp and d

1090
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,940
0,420 450,660 660,840 840,930 930,1080
sharp, what key are we

1091
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,720
0,120 120,510
in there.|

1092
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,670
0,540 900,1200 1200,1290 1290,1800 1950,2130
E remember the rule you

1093
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,510
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,660 660,840
go a half step up

1094
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,530
0,120 120,210 210,510 510,930 930,1020
from the last sharp the

1095
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,880
0,240 240,510 510,630 630,870 870,1350
last sharp is d sharp

1096
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,990
0,270 270,480 480,630 630,780 780,960
half step up from that

1097
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,920
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,660
would be an e.|

1098
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,640

0,180 180,330 330,690 720,1560 1560,1920
you would be memorize those

1100
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,710
0,510 510,1170 1170,1470 1470,2280 2520,3150
keys memorize those scales learn

1101
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,910
0,90 90,420 420,540 540,930 930,1200

0,90 90,330 330,660 660,750 750,900
it takes time to get

1105
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,610
0,90 90,450 480,1080 1080,1260 1260,1530
